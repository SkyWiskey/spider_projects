"I spent this morning making sure my visit to Guilin/Guangxi didn't go completely to waste. I was assisted by an earlier than desired wake-up call from the next door school and the loud group of Spaniards who clattered into my dorm at 2am.   I hiked around the Diecai Hill Park. The karst scenery here is quite a spectacle, a very unique sight. I'm not really sure, and not terribly interested, in the geography behind it all but it was nice to see some of the scenery..."
"Saturday 19thBreakfast in the hostel; a very large portion of museli with fruit and eggs on toast for Frank. With tea and coffee. I spotted a small yellow lizard on the window ledge too.Unfortunately the stress of the night before spilled over into the following morning. We had to arrange our final train journey to Hong Kong. Back in March we had booked tickets from Guangzhou East ('near' Guilin) to Hong Kong departing at 14:04, to get us out of China just fo..."
"So! Our first stop in China and what a journey to get there!! Starting with a sleeper train from Vietnam, 24 hours later... Covering 2 border crossings, navigating a mental Chinese train station (twice), somehow using sign language to describe our hostel name as we only had it written in English and all locals can read are Chinese symbols (and the hostel being on the other side of the city), we made it... Guilin wasn't one of China's big cities but as we came to realise, a smaller city in China was still massively bigger than one such as Birmingham and has about 4 million people! We had a few days in the city before heading onwards to our first main place of interest.What surprised us most was how clean, orderly, modern and nice the city was. Not a piece of litter in sight, modern technology everywhere but combined nicely with old fashioned and Chinese cultural buildings and style. The people were friendly and a lot of attention was put on the parks, lake and scenery. All of the opposite to what you're led to believe in 'the west' about China. In one of the restaurants they even had robot waiters!!We spent our time just pottering around, taking it all in as it was the first stop. It's easy now to realise why Chinese tourists look so amazed when they are visiting London, very different places! We found a really nice bustling food market in the evening. Had a few local beers (of which are all strangely weak, normally about 3%) and some great street food. Grilled dumplings, meat sticks, potatoes, but loads more we didn't get to try. The street food was really reasonably priced and nice.The city is famous for two huge Pagoda buildings in the main lake which lit up at night, a really cool sight. Walking around the city had a nice feel about it as well, and it seemed a safe place to visit which was nice especially in a country so different.On first arrival when we began to plan our next few stops we quickly realised that a few things would make travelling in China a bit more challenging. Without a 'VPN' app, Google isn't accessible and as a foreigner you can't book direct trains etc... without paying ridiculous fees. As we are also travelling in prime Chinese tourist season trains get booked up fast, all of which means we quickly needed to plan further in advance and pay a bit more than anticipated. However that aside and apart from the initial chaotic journey, we had a very good introduction to China and looked forward to the next month!"
"Well, it's been a little warmer here than Beijing, but also very very wet! Our arrival didn't go too well either. For the second time in two months, Tony's bag never made it. Thankfully the airline delivered it to our hostel the next afternoon. Hopefully this will be the last time our bags go missing! Guilin doesn't really offer much, the sites it does have, an extortionate entry fee is charged. We walked along the river and as w approached a rock where a natural hole has formed and as such it resembles an elephant drinking from the water, our path ended and we were forced to leave the area. We found that hoarding had been erected so you couldn't see anything!! If you did want to, you pay a Â£6 entry!! Imagine that back home. A day in the Lakes or the Dales would cost you a fortune! It certainly makes you realise how lucky we are back home. We were only using Guilin as our base to head to the Longji rice terraces. We arrived yesterday in absolutely pouring rain and even with waterproof trousers, jacket and rain poncho, we were still wet. There is a walk you can do from Dazhai to Ping'an which takes around five hours, if you know the way! The map provided in LP, in the park and which we'd found on line, weren't detailed at all. As soon as we left the lookout points that Chinese tourists visit once they've stepped off the cable car- yes, another scenic spot that has a cable car to allow easy access, the signage stopped. Where our map showed one path, there were four to choose from which would then lead to another split in the path. I'm useless at map reading and have little sense of direction so I blindly follow Tony, which never worries me as he always gets us to where we need to go. This time though I could tell he was losing patience and confidence, and we were heading further into rice terraces, mist coming in and darkness approaching. Data roaming was turned on and Google maps consulted. We looked too far north of the next village we were heading to, although the rice terraces could curve around which would lead us in the right direction. Still, even reaching that we had another two hour walk onto our final destination and we didn't know if the next village would have lodgings. Soaked to the bone we had no option but to double back for a few miles or face an evening sheltering under a rock. We headed back to the last village we had come through and seen a YHA. It turned out to be, without a doubt, the worst place we have stayed on our travels and probably in all my years of travelling. The room smelt of mould and sewage, it was a squat toilet, the bedding was damp, no soap or shower gel were provided, no clothes pegs to hang our wet clothes to dry, the staff unhelpful and the food had to be sent back. Â£12.50. It was marginally better than spending the night in the field. On the plus side it had wifi which we used to great effect. We decided we definitely needed some R&R and sunshine and so changed our travel itinerary and booked a flight to Southern Thailand for five days cabbaging by a pool and beach. Some sunshine, a bit of luxury, a few Singha's or Chang's and some hot and spicy Thai food will revitalise us for Vietnam and the rest of our travels. We both are feeling exhausted after 19 weeks on the go. We're now on a mini van heading back to Guilin to collect our luggage and catch another bus onto Yangshou. The weather forecast suggests sunshine and 9 degrees for the next few days so we plan to get out cycling and walking through the countryside. We have also booked somewhere to stay that looks great and it's the same price as the awful YHA. The rain didn't stop at all last night and it's more torrential this morning than it was yesterday. Last night we made the decision after talking to the other hostel guest, not to continue to Ping'an. She'd also got lost during the day, met some people who walked from Ping'an who said it wasnt easy and the hostel said there were no direct buses back to Guilin and we would have to go to Longshen and change. This would have meant getting back to Guilin either late tonight or even tomorrow, reducing our time in Yangshou so, feeling slightly defeated, we booked our bus tickets for this morn, from the same spot we got dropped off yesterday lunch. Looking at the weather though, we definitely made the right decision. The photos we have seen of the rice terraces in all four seasons are spectacular. Ours look a little dismal but I'm still really glad I've seen them and up until around 3pm yesterday when it became apparent that finding our way really was a challenge, I was enjoying being in the countryside, away from crowds of people, not breathing in pollution and just generally being surrounded by nature. Even though it was pouring down and we'd paid a tenner each entry fee! Next stop, Yangshou and better weather, hopefully."
"I got to Guilin pretty late in the day, so had a meander round town and a pretty quiet one in the hostel. Next day I got up to catch a bus that took me to Li River, where we'd hop on our bamboo raft to Yangshuo. There wasn't actually any bamboo on board - just PVC - but was a nice trip spent with a Chinese girl and her parents. After the scenic journey they offer you another tour down the 'best part' of the river, on actual bamboo. We had a bit of time before that and so went and checked into the hostel where I met Sapphire, a Chinese girl climbing the hills in Yangshuo by day, and cracking out belly dancing and playing with fire in street performances by night. When I got to the bamboo raft the Chinese lady had asked to partner me so we cruised down the river trying to add a bit of momentum into the conversation. She looked about 21 and told me she had a 14 year old son. So either she was breastfeeding at 8 or looked a lot younger than she was. Turns out it's the latter and she's 41. Her parents carried on getting snaps of me at any given opportunity, and based on their reaction, I'm in the family album.Later on I went back and had a meal with Sapphire and then this Ukranian girl from our room joined. Sapphire said she was allergic to alcohol so we didn't go out out in Yangshuo, but at night the place transforms into the kind of thing you'd expect to see in Dixie TV!Next day I rented out a mountain bike and firstly went to the toursity areas, climbing Moon Hill and going in the Cold Water Cave but unfortunately the camera died mid-cave. I then went out into some really rural villages and after a few hours of going deeper into the unknown and struggling to get any info re my whereabouts from the locals I finally found myself and got back on track. I went back to Guilin that evening, had a mellow one and played some pool in the hostel and got on the Longji rice terrace tour for the next day. Was a really good one, the tour didn't cater much for the English speakers on board but was quite a scene nonetheless!"
"NÇhÇo!I'm in Guilin at the moment but will later be catching a bus to Yangshou (my last stop in China!).The weather is not so good today. I was woken up by the rain! Somebody told me the weather down here is really good as well hahaa On a plus note, I had a whole dorm room to my self last night woo.**WARNING LONG STORY**Anyhuuu yesterday was a right adventure. Alex is back on the scene hahaa he flew in from Xi'an on Thursday evening. Before he came I met some Chinese people (2 guys and a girl) who could hardly speak English and arranged that we would go with them to the Longji rice terraces to save some money as the hostel tour was expensive. The rice terraces are 37 miles out of the city and the Chinese helped us get there by public bus. I must quickly say that I had Oreo pancakes for breakfast yesterday and they are BEAUTTT. I'm considering going and watching the man make them today but I'm also afraid to see a Chinese kitchen so will probably pass.Back to my story :)So we met at 8am and headed off for the bus. The Chinese folk ordered us a taxi to the bus station and we all squeezed in. The bus journey was around 1 1/2 hour and then we had to jump on another bus to the terraces. There are three terraces, Longji, PingAn and Dazhai and we were going to Dazhai. At last minute the Chinese guys decided to go to PingAn first as they were staying the night at Dazhai. They told us to make sure we get the last bus from Dazhai at 1:30pm to PingAn and then the last bus there at 5:30pm so we can get to the bus station on time.So we got to Dazhai and thought we could hike up to the peak for an hour and back town in time for the bus. There was a cable cart which was Â£12 so we passed on that idea. So we are heading to the mountain/hill base and ask these white guys how long it takes. They tell us they stayed up the mountain and that you can walk to PingAn in 3/4 hours. We check the distance and it's only 4.4miles once we get to the first village. For some reason we decided that was a fab idea and got the details on how to navigate through the terraces - details being 3 names of villages. As our day had turned into a hike we thought me must eat first. There was a small little food hut that was cheap so we ordered there. Alex had the meat noodle dish, not sure you could call it ""meat""! I went for vegetable noodles as did the guys we just met from Holland. After our munch I grabbed a snickers, a Fanta and a small pot of Pringles and off we went.It was really cool walking up the mountain through the villages of minority Chinese people. This group of people were called the Yao minority and they were women with incredibly long hair! About half an our in I felt abit sick and knew that it was the food but pressed on and drank my Fanta. The terraces were awesome and I used my selfie stick plenty of times! We finally got to the top and the view was great. We were using an app called maps.me where you can navigate when you have no Internet through Gps. It had the mountain tracks on and our direction so we used that to make our way through the terraces.The hike wasn't easy but I wouldn't say it was hard after climbing Mount Emei. We were constantly checking the time and realised we needed to pick up the pace. We got through the winding paths, up hill, down hill through slate and rock tracks. My best friend were my hiking boots! We passed a few villages. Had way more photos as the rice terraces seemed to get bigger and bigger. It's amazing how they have created this system.We get to the 2nd village. We had 1 more village between where we were and our last stop and checked the time. We had about 3 miles to go and 2 hours to get there. We thought if we pace up then we could make it. Flatland was good because we could go faster, downhill was okay but had to watch our step so we didn't fall down the mountain and uphill was steep! Alex nearly fell off the bambo bridge lmao literally almost slipped to his death.We decide to march on. By this time I was really feeling sick. I could feel inside me like poison and knew I had to get it out.  We reached the next village and I went and vomited up the evil. Added Dioralyte to my water bottle, munched my snickers and felt way better. We now had 1 hour and a half to make about 2 miles.Once it hit 5pm we were going so fast. It was slowly creeping to sunset and we knew we had to get out of the terraces. We made it to a road at 5:10pm. We made our way up the road and heard a car approaching. Great idea - HITCH HIKING. We stuck out our thumb and jumped in lmao. The men drove us up the mountain which was way further than we thought. It was 5:22 and the map said 0.3 miles to the bus station. We were going to make it! The man got a phone call and he must be the only driver in China who drives legally because he stopped the car and answered the phone to have a conversation. We were thinking come on!! We have a bus to catch. We make it to the station at 5:26 go to the desk and ask for the bus to Longsheng bus station where we catch our bus back to Guilin. The man laughed and pointed to the sign and said last bus 5pm!!! Oppppppsieeeee. Now we need to get to Longsheng, 8miles away!We asked a man to take us but his car was full. This woman was trying to get us to get a taxi for 20 pound but we refuse the extortion and start walking. A few minutes down the mountain and we see a car and once again stick out our thumbs. A man pulls up with a what looks like his wife and 3 daughters - the car is full. We show him where we wanted to go in Chinese and say sorry it doesn't matter your car is full. The guy thinks a moment speaks in Chinese and tells us to get in!! Alex get the front seat and us 5 women in the back hahaa. The family were such happy people!! They were talking Chinese and laughing all the way. It took 30 minutes to get to the bus station!!!! We would have been walking for hours. We say our thanks and run to the bus terminal. By now it's 6:15pm.The lady looked concerned and says no buses. Gets on her walkie talkie and tells us she thinks there are no more buses at this time. Great we are going to have to catch a ride 37 miles to our hostel hahaha she told us to check the main road incase one drives by. It's 6:20 now and we see the road and we think we see a bus. We run and the lady shouts Guilin!! Omg yessssss! A bus! We jump on sooo happy and as we sit down the bus leaves =|The universe worked its magic for us. A 1 minute delay would have meant we missed the last bus back to our city.We got back to the city eventually but then had to work out where we were and how to get to the hostel. Some girl helped us and told us the bus number. We waited a while thinking about getting a taxi instead and then jumped on the bus. The man said it was the right one when we showed him the Chinese address and we hoped for the best. I couldn't believe it when we made it back to the hostel alive.The day turned into an adventure through minority Chinese villages and rice terraces. It was amazing to see them living in nature and surviving away from the Chinese city life. My universe kicked in and kept us safe all day haGuilin was fun. On to Yangshou in a few hours - tonight is Halloweeeeeen."
"We got the bullet train from Shenzhen to Guilin, Casson was excited and was waiting to see how fast it went, at it's peak it went 305km per hour. We arrived in Guilin and got a bus into town and had no idea where we were so we jumped in a taxi to get to our hotel. You should have seen the state of it, its without doubt the worst room we've booked throughout our entire trip. Every single wall was covered in damp and the paint was peeling off in sheets. The toilet was a squat pan and water (or toilet water) from another bathroom ran down the wall and onto our bathroom floor. I thought it was hilarious but Casson was devastated as it was the first room he'd booked in our 8 months so far. I'm not sure what he was expecting, it was Â£3 a night. The smell of damp in the room got straight on our throats so we decided to head out as Casson was in need of a beer, it was about 9pm by this time. We ended up sat on a fountain at a really busy intersection drinking cans of beer from the shop till about midnight as this was preferable to being in the room. Whilst random it was a really funny night. On the way back to the room we called in and asked the price at another hotel, it was Â£8 a night so we decided to move the next morning.Once we got back Casson was still going on about the room and I was still laughing about it and then it happened .... he spotted something crawling on the bed which could have been baby cockroaches, not so funny any more was it? We packed up and moved that night. Note to Casson, cheap is not always better!Guilin was not what we expected, we thought we were heading to the countryside but it was a huge city surrounded by Karst peaks, rivers and lakes. It was still really nice though. On our first full day we headed to Folded Brocade Hill which was a peak you could climb to see really good views of the city.The following day we went to the reed flute cave, when we got there a man approached us and said it was a 15 minute walk to the entrance or we could go 10 minutes on a bamboo raft for a Â£1 each. We know that they always lie about times but for a quid each we went for the bamboo raft. We literally did a 5 minute circuit of a lake and got dropped off a 5 minute walk from where we started, it's a good job we've learnt to laugh at the ridiculous scams they have everywhere.The cave was huge and full of stalactites and stalagmites but we couldn't really take it all in for laughing. It was lit up like Santa's grotto, there was neon lighting everywhere and tour guides using microphones whilst herding people through.We really wanted to go and see the rice terraces but to do it on our own was a bit of a logistical nightmare so we decided to book a tour which was easier said than done. We speak no Chinese and the tour operator spoke no English but we walked out of his office with a ticket and a pick up time for the following day. We struck lucky though as our tour guide spoke perfect English so he could tell us which way to walk and where to meet. We were taking the mic saying we won't get lost as our guide had a long pole with a flag on it but when we looked around all the guides had an identical flag. At first we thought we were on the wrong tour as we had trainers on and ruc sacks with us and a lot of the women had dresses and high heels on and fancy handbags but no we were on the right tour and that's just the way they roll.The rice terraces were lovely, we had to take a little golf buggy up to the first platform as the guide wanted us all to stay together at first. We would have preferred to walk, especially as the driver reversed into a fence when he pulled up! Once up there we went off on our own, it was a couple of hours walk and the views were amazing. We followed the directions we were given and ended up right at the top but realised we didn't know if we were meeting the group at the top or if we had to go back down. We ended up following some girls in matching pink t shirts who didn't speak a word of English but we thought we recognised them from our bus, our plan was almost fundamentally flawed when they didn't get on the bus when we did as we could have been following anyone but they did in the end.On the bus back the guide got out some combs and perfume and started giving it the big sell, it looked like cheap imitation perfume but the Chinese were loving it and they were handing money over by the fistful, we pulled up by the side of the road and the guide collected all his orders from a tuk tuk that was waiting there. Bizarre doesn't even cover it.We've got another tour booked tomorrow, hope its as good as this one as it was also booked with minimal use of English and maximum use of charadesGeneral points1) We're back in the danger zone, not only are the mopeds crazy on the  roads, they all ride on the pavement so you're not even safe there and to top it off, the electric bikes like to conserve their battery by riding with no lights on ..... at night!2) The Chinese are mega loud, why speak normally when you can shout?3) They are shopping crazy and will buy absolutely anything, especially if someone is hyping it up4) I'm a local celebrity, people keep asking if they can have their picture with me. If China had Facebook I'd have gone viral by now5) They like to stare A LOT. We've taken to staring back, it seems to throw them6) We're loving China"
"Yay for leaving China on this day! Woke up early once a frickingen. Get taxi to Guilin north then fat train to Guangzhou South. Sat next to daughter on her moms lap- so cute, posed for photos as Laura slept. Next metro to Guangzhou East and train to Kowloon. HK like a different country. Metro to hostel which smells funny and sleeps 9. So much humidity! Get excited in supermarket with fresh fruit and english food. Found by hot American and guided to cinema. Trekke..."

The Yangshuo mountain retreat is the nicest hotel I have stayed at and the staff were so welcoming, we even received a free water flask as a thank you for staying.Before our flight to Chengdu we stopped at the Reed flute caves, one of the largest nature caves in Guilin. The stalagmites/tites had formed over millions of years and created amazing shapes. The only di..."
We made it! Just eight pieces of bamboo lashed together with a makeshift seat for two tied on top ... and a good young man with a very long pole. Now that is adventure.Mac bought me my garland of flowers and helped me on board and we were away for a leisurely float down the Yulong River. The scenery was spectacular. The little dams and waterfalls along the way provided a bit of variety and the stall holders floating in the middle of the river gave us a few chuckl...
"Tokyo er kÃ¦mpe stort. Mellem smÃ¥ gyder med gadekÃ¸kkener og skyskrabere i stÃ¥l og glas ligger high-end tÃ¸jbutikker og fiskehandlere side om side. Det ene Ã¸jeblik er vi pÃ¥ Fifth Avenue og det nÃ¦ste er vi pÃ¥ smÃ¥ lokale markeder, hvor der faldbydes tydeligt falske varer. Vores eneste chance for at forarbejde alle de indtryk, er at vi nu har vÃ¦ret en rum tid i Solens Rige, og derfor har vÃ¦nnet os til de smÃ¥ ting der fÃ¸rst stak os blÃ¥r i Ã¸jnene. Det er derfor ikke ligesÃ¥ overvÃ¦ldene, men pÃ¥ en mÃ¥de ogsÃ¥ fedt, for det giver os mulighed for at fÃ¸le vi hÃ¸rer lidt mere til, og ikke bare er turister i en fremmed verden. Udover bare at subbe (vi tager undergrundsbanen overalt, ligesom alle andre) rundt i hovedstaden og suge stemningen ind, har vi vÃ¦ret ved nogle berÃ¸mte templer, flotte parker og vilde markeder, med mere skrammel end gadets.dk, der fÃ¥r MellemÃ¸stens kopimarkeder til at ligne en Tigerbutik. Alt sammen indhyllet i en herlig duft af fisk og tang, der er alle vegne. Blandt de mere ekstraordinÃ¦re oplevelser var sumobrydning. Der er kun turnering i juni-august, men vi fik mulighed for at overvÃ¦re en trÃ¦ning. Vi mÃ¥tte se igennem en rude, men vi var alligevel meget tÃ¦t pÃ¥, og det gav os mulighed for at forevige Ã¸jeblikket, der ellers normalt er meget privat og strengt forbudt for uvedkommende at overvÃ¦re. Det var et imponerende display af rÃ¥ muskelkraft, og sÃ¥dan vi forestiller os at det ser ud nÃ¥r et par laksefede grÃ¥bjÃ¸rne banker ind i hinanden. Bryderne vejer mellem 140 og 160 kg, selvom de sjÃ¦ldent er over 1,80 og indtager 20.000 kalorier om dagen for at holde kampvÃ¦gten, men ikke fÃ¸r fem timers benhÃ¥rd trÃ¦ning tidlig morgen - hver dag. Der er massere af muskel under polstringen, ingen tvivl om det. Kaja stortrives, selvom vi glÃ¦der os til lidt mere plads. Hun er blevet ret vild med japansk bÃ¸rnefjernesyn, og vi har nu et par videoer mere at tilfÃ¸je repertoiret af youtube underholdning. Vi har mÃ¸dt et dansk par hernede, der flyttede hertil fordi fyren fik job. De har selv en lille pige, og det var sjovt at hÃ¸re deres udfordringer og erfaringer. Pigen fortalte blandt andet at IKEA hernede er fuldstÃ¦ndig ligesom derhjemme, sÃ¥ der kÃ¸ber hun rugbrÃ¸dsblanding og frikadeller.PÃ¥ grund af Ã¦ndringer i flytiderne, tilbragte vi en nat i Shanghai pÃ¥ Kilroys regning. Det vidste sig at vÃ¦re en behagelig oplevelse, pÃ¥ et firestjerne hotel, komplet med stort gulvareal til tumle, minibar, roomservice og allerbedst en kÃ¦mpe dobbeltseng. Den stÃ¸rste overraskelse var dog morgenmadsbuffeten, der var noget at det mest omfangsringe vi nogensinde har oplevet. Kvaliteten var hÃ¸j og udvalget enormt, og vi har ikke fÃ¥et det bedre derhjemme. Det slog selv Hilton og Marriott i Qatar og Oman, hvilket ikke siger sÃ¥ lidt ifÃ¸lge Emil. Det var selvfÃ¸lgelig ikke sÃ¦rlig kulturelt berigende, men noget vi virkelig trÃ¦ngte til efter de trÃ¦nge kÃ¥r i Tokyo.Kina er helt anderledes. For det fÃ¸rste regner det hele tiden. Vi har sÃ¥ fundet ud af at vi er her midt i regnsÃ¦sonen, sÃ¥ det er der nok ikke noget at gÃ¸re ved, men vi fÃ¥r det bedste ud af det. Den fÃ¸rste uge af maj har alle kinesere (der er immervÃ¦k et par stykker) ferie i forbindelse med arbejdernes kampdag, og Yangshou (hvor vi skal hen nÃ¦st) er kinesernes foretrukne feriested, sÃ¥ vi er spÃ¦ndte pÃ¥ om vi bliver lÃ¸bet over ende. I forhold til japanerne, er kineserne uhumske, egocentriske og meget hÃ¸jlydte. Vi tager det som en del af oplevelsen, men voksne mÃ¦nd, der spytter og prutter pÃ¥ gaden, skubber foran i kÃ¸en og rÃ¥ber selvom de gÃ¥r ved siden af hinanden er noget af et kulturchok. Vi bor i Guilin pÃ¥ et hyggeligt lille hostel, sammen med mennesker fra hele verden i alle aldre, sÃ¥ det er rigtig fint. Vores vÃ¦relse er koldt og fugtigt, men det koster heller ingen ting. Til gengÃ¦ld bor vi lige ned til floden, hvor der er rigtig flot, og vi har fundet et lille te hus, hvor der er meget tranquilt. En lille oase, der nÃ¦sten gÃ¸r det op for at teen er voldsom dyr. Langs floden ser vi tai chi i de tidlige morgentimer, og nyder udsigten til de to pagoder der ligger her i rolige omgivelser. Kaja har fÃ¥et et par fine smÃ¥ sko, og Ã¸ver og Ã¸ver, men vi lader hende kun komme ned pÃ¥ vÃ¦relset og i stormagasiner, fordi her er sÃ¥ beskidt alle vegne. Vi har vÃ¦ret ude og spise ""rigtig"" kinesisk et par gange, og det fungere fint at pege og krydse fingre. Heldigvis er Kaja ikke krÃ¦sen. Hun har efterhÃ¥nden smagt lidt af hvert. Den stÃ¸rste udfordring er at man mÃ¥ ryge over det hele - som i alle steder, og kineserne ryger mens de spiser? Det betyder, at hvis vi vil spise andre steder end pÃ¥ Starbucks, KFC og MacDonalds, sÃ¥ mÃ¥ vi finde os i massiv passiv rygning, og det gÃ¸r ondt i vores forÃ¦ldrehjerter, men sÃ¥dan er virkeligheden bare. Heldigvis spise vi meget tidligt pÃ¥ grund af stumpen, sÃ¥ vi slipper for overfyldte restauranter. Kineserne er helt skudt i Kaja! Det grÃ¦nser til irriterende, men vi har lÃ¦rt bare at smile og gÃ¥ videre i uÃ¦ndret tempo, ligesom pÃ¥ basarerne i Tyrkiet. Vi har vÃ¦nnet os til at hele familier sÃ¦tter sig ved borde ved siden af os, uden at bestille noget, og bare siger mÃ¦rkelige lyde og glor pÃ¥ barnet, og i dag oplevede vi at guldlok stjal showet, selvom vi stod og sÃ¥ pÃ¥ tre dvÃ¦rge i mavebluser synge folkemusik. Det er ikke kun Kaja der fÃ¥r blikke, de glor ogsÃ¥ pÃ¥ Emil, der fÃ¸ler sig som Dennis Rodman i Nord Korea. Vi forestiller os dog at det er misundelse og beundring, og lader bare som om vi er smigret nÃ¥r alle tjenerne pÃ¥ restauranten omringer os med skÃ¦ve tÃ¦nder og blinkene smartphones. Vi gÃ¸r os umage med ikke at se verden igennem en linse, for ikke at fÃ¸le os sÃ¥ turistet, men der skal nok komme lidt snapshots nÃ¥r vi finder en bedre forbindelse. I morgen skal vi fire timer ned af floden pÃ¥ river cruise mod Yangshou og et dejlig stort vÃ¦relse med balkon. Turen derned regnes for den flotteste udsigt i hele riget, og pryder eksempelvis 20 sedlen, sÃ¥ vi venter os meget."
"After an almighty thunderstorm overnight, Yangshuo was sunny and warm. We haggled on the quayside for a trip on a 'bamboo' raft to see the Cormorant fisherman. After a lot of shouting on her phone, the fisherman's wife rounded up her husband and son, who towed his dad's raft next to ours to a backwater where the cormorants had a noose put around their necks to prevent them swallowing their catch.

"After Suzhou it was time to head south into Guangxi province. Guilin is famous mainly for being the image people often think of when they think of sterotypical China. The lush mountains in the area have that iconic cone shape and tower of relatively flat plains around them. The effect is spectacular. Running through the middle of the city is the river you see those iconic shots of raft fishermen using cormorants to bring in their catch. Being far south, the winter hadn't hit Guilin hard and so was still relatively green in appearance - just not so blooming is it meant to be in the summer.Once again, just like Suzhou, we hired bikes to look around the city. The suburbs of the city are more like little villages, without the bustle of a city, and with plenty of (relative to general China) peace and quiet. Apparently many western holidaymakers to Guilin are shocked at how run-down the small surrounding towns are. Most of us thought they were lovely.If we had cycled a bit further, we could have got right out into the countryside but we didn't quite get there. Instead we did go up onto one of those iconic mountains for a view over the city. The views over the city were great, and the chinglish on the way up was even more spectacular; a personal favourite being the sign ordering 'no wrong poses' on a slide down part of the mountain.Like many of the locations, I considered coffee a tourist attraction. A good thing to, as Guilin is developing as a bit of a coffee town in the grand scale of China. There was a lovely tree-lined street with bookshops and coffee shops - just like home!Guilin has really developed as a major tourist destination and so the sightseeing prices have rocketed. We did nonetheless get to one well known sight in the area - the reed flute caves. These caves should have been stunning. The only problem is that China has a different idea of what makes a natural wonder into a tourist destination, so instead of leaving it as it is, with some simple lights to show the way, the whole place was lit up in flourescent lights like some kind of Giant stony inside-out Christmas tree. It was impressive, but the light show was really not needed.And neither was the random unexplained video of Dinosaurs and sharks that got projected onto the side of the cave in the main area.But that is China for you! Sometimes you just can't understand it, no matter how hard you try...One of our favourite things about Guilin, strangely enough, was actually the hostel. The staff were fabulous and great fun, the other people staying there were cool, and the place in general was rather comfortable.They also had the only nice Baijiu in the whole of China. Unless southern Baijiu is actually ok!Guilin also was the place I realised that I, although it is a little odd, get to practice my German with Germans more in China than I do in England. Nearly every hostel in China seems to have numerous German guests, and Guilin was no exception.Now, that is possibly all I have to say for Guilin. We didn't take any boat rides, as they were too expensive. We didn't go the rice paddies, as they were too expensive. We didn't go on a raft ride, as it was too expensive. So the last thing to say, is that if you consider going to Guilin and want to do many of the touristy things, bring some cash with you.And that was basically the end of the travels. I'll say a quick thing about the stop in Xi'an (for the sole purpose of breaking up a long journey into two) and the unexpected visit to Fukang on the way home, simply so I can complete that lovely map that is developing on the blog.Thanks for reading!"
"Hallo der hjemme :-) SÃ¥ er vi rejst fra Xi'an, hvor vi havde det dejligt luksoriÃ¸st. Nu er vi sÃ¥ kommet til Guilin som er omringet af betagende klippebjerge og skÃ¸n natur. Det er en blandet fornÃ¸jelse, for nok er det billigt her pÃ¥ hostellet, men det lugter nu lidt af pis pÃ¥ vores vÃ¦relse, og det vestlige toilet er erstattet med et hul i gulvet (som ogsÃ¥ fungerer som aflÃ¸b for bruseren) og der medfulgte ogsÃ¥ et par gennemskidte underhylere som lÃ¥ gemt pÃ¥ et vandrÃ¸r (puha - ""ren"" hygge). SÃ¥ derfor har vi brugt det meste af dagen ude i byen hvor luften pÃ¥ trods af smog var lidt friskere.Der er virkelig mange mennesker her og selvom denne by kun er en ""lille"" storby er den alligevel stÃ¸rre end Kbh! Byen er fyldt med markeder og tilfÃ¦ldigvis da vi ledte efte en MCD fordi at Ditte var sulten (Ã¥hÃ¥h), fandt vi et elektronik marked hvor man kunne fÃ¥ nÃ¦sten alt lige fra gammelt computer skrot til vÃ¦rktÃ¸j og elektronik komponenter, lige noget for Elias! Der brugte vi sÃ¥ mindst 2timer pÃ¥ at lede efter nogle meget specifikke dimser, som vi desvÃ¦rre ikke fandt alle af, pÃ¥ trods af at vi til sidst havde en meget flink og ihÃ¦rdig ung fyr til at gÃ¥ i rÃ¸ven pÃ¥ os og hjÃ¦lpe os med at finde et lÃ¦s NEMA17 stepper motorer, men det var omtrent den eneste ting der ikke var at finde der... Ãv! TilgengÃ¦ld kunne han pege os mod den nÃ¦rmeste McD, der var lang vej, men vi klarede den og vi sÃ¥ en masse af byen pÃ¥ vej derhen.PÃ¥ vej tilbage fandt vi nogle gadeskomagere som kunne fikse den hÃ¦l pÃ¥ Elias' stÃ¸vle som gik i stykker inden afrejsen. Vi er rimelig sikre pÃ¥ at hun tog os lidt ved nÃ¦sen, ihvertfald grinte hun meget da vi gik derfra efter at have betalt ca. 60kr for lapning og pudsning, men hvad fanden nu er stÃ¸vlerne sÃ¥ gode som nye :-) Nu sidder vi i lobbyen pÃ¥ hostellet - som pÃ¥ trods af lidt dÃ¥rlig lugt i vÃ¦relset faktisk er meget hyggelig, personalet er unge, friske og hjÃ¦lpsommelige. SÃ¥ vi har lige booket os ind pÃ¥ en bambooraft tour imorgen ned af li-floden, som render igennem Guilin. Det skal vi sammen med en Ã¦ldre fransk og frisk herre, som ogsÃ¥ bor her pÃ¥ hostellet, sÃ¥ det skal nok blive spÃ¦ndende.Hyg jer og hold jer muntre.Kram fra Ditte og Elias"
"Ni hao true believers! And welcome back. After an extended break from blogging (due to blog overload) I'm back to finish off the 'Spring festival' Series of blogs. These next two blogs will be rather short and show the highlights of my last two destinations, Guilin and Xi'an, as we did rather little in both of these places due to travel fatigue. I won't hold back any longer, here we go....Train journey length: 22 hours Total: 73 hours travelingDistance: 930 miles Total: 5200 milesWe woke up in Suzhou and made our way across the town to the train station. Once there we all bustled into the waiting area and grabbed so,e food. It was a magic moment; a baguette (erie?) was to be found in the center of the station so I grabbed then most delicious baguette I'd ever had (in hindsight, mediocre but I had not eaten no sweet bread, or a sandwich, since arrival). And then came another sad moment in our journey; åè§to Nick and Claire. They had decided, for their own reasons, not to join us on the next leg of the journey so we said our goodbyes and awaited for the train; Me, Stephen Rowland, Jacob, Alex ,Tim and Anya. When it was time to board the train we were excited. This was no normal train though; this was one of the fabled bullet trains. We all climbed aboard in awe of the thing. There were seats with plugs, internet connection, trays, seats that recline and are actually comfortable. The train that took us 2 1/2 hours on the way there took us 20 minutes on the way back. It was an amazing experience but back handed; it really was a kick in the crown jewels considering what we had to experience next.Once we got off the bullet train, in no time at all really, we hopped onto the subway and shuttled across town to our next destination; another train station. Once there we boarded the next train for our 21 hour journey in hard seats. In all honesty it was not that bad at all. We had a group of seats (8 of them) to ourselves and it allowed me to stretch my legs out a lot. As ever time dripped past. I managed to get a fare bit sleep on this one though and eventually we arrived in Guilin. We checked into our hostel (Guilin Wada hostel, I cannot recommend it more, read on..) and settled into our rooms, all separate. Later on in the evening our partners in crime Mr Daniel Shawn Donald Sherwood-Clarke (he was named for great things) and my companion of old Stephen Erhorn arrived at the hostel. We ate a banquet type meal and split the costs before kicking back in the hostelHere are the highlights of Guilin; the hostel. Wada hostel has become holy ground for the members of project that spent time there. Most of us (not me though) took up a wonderful challenge; drink 12 beers, get a hostel t-shirt. Game on. The staff were an absolute delight (all female, I must mention), the drinks we're completely reasonable and the atmosphere was really friendly. I ate some amazing western style food over 6the course of that week including, but not limited to; one American breakfast, one English breakfast, pancakes... more than I had the money for in all honesty. There was a TV room with a huge selection of movies, a fantastic reading room, free clothes washing facilities, a great lounge area and a pool table. Not only that but they had things to do on evenings; one evening we all made dumplings and ate far too many of them. Another night was BBQ and, again, it was too much food but also included a 'homemade China shot' which turned out to be some pretty smooth ç½éand we met a lot of people through these events. Finally were the rooms; bliss. A heated blanket for everyone as it was cold, personal light, curtains for your bed and the bed itself was extremely soft. I love that place and if I ever get the chance again I shall be staying there. If only all hostels were like heaven.Another highlight was almost certainly the people. We met several incredibly lovely people. Two German girls arrived one day and stayed the duration of the week and we got chatting. They were both studying Chinese in Beijing; one was a Chinese/ German girl called Sisi who had moved to Germany at birth and couldn't speak much Chinese so decided to come learn in China. We had a lot of fun with those two girls talking, drinking and one night we all crammed into the small movie room, 8 of us in a room for 4, and watched district 9 which was really nice. They also were experiencing similar problems to us with China so it was nice to talk. Another night a host of Americans arrived who were doing short, 2-3 day trips in countries across all of Asia via a boat, provided by their universities. They were all extremely lovely people and most had not left the US before so it was, again, great to get a new perspective on China from people who knew so little about it. The last two to mention (we met many more wonderful people in this place) was an Australian chap and a Slovenian gentlemen. They were traveling together on business and gave us a lot of praise for what we are doing in China, were very in awe and did buy us a few drinks (always a bonus). To those who stood by us in Guilin; I salute you. You helped shape me more than I will ever know.What did we do in Guilin itself? It has to be said, less than we should have. One of the days we decided to grab bikes, as it had been so much fun in Suzhou, and head out into the city to explore, map in hand. We ended up following the river all the way along to the outskirts of the town and saw some incredible sights along the way; on the river we saw a man using a boat made of plastic tubing use a crane to catch fish, which was pretty special (did feel more like a tourist attraction though). On our route we got to see a lot of the older parts of Guilin were the roads were somewhat lacking in stability and sometimes the roads lacked road at all and were simply dirt tracks. Once we started heading back our route took us to one of the spectacular and fabled mountains situated in the center of Guilin. Guilin is a city built around these awesome mounds of dense greenery, caves and rugged black rocks. We decided to ascend one of them and got an amazing view of the whole city (see the photo attached to this blog). It felt very much like another moment not long gone in Shanghai; that feeling of pure awesome disbelief that I was standing there overlooking a whole city. It felt like being A giant amongst the little people. Simply amazing. We descended shortly after that photo was taken and made our way back into town, the hostel and relaxation.Another highlight, for much unexpected reasons, was the Guilin Reed flute cave. This is a cave thousands of years old and full of amazing stone structures; stalagmites, stalagmites, some stalaghighs, stalaglows. It was something I looked forward to greatly. On the way there we missed our bus stop by one ended got dropped off a half mile down the road but I am so glad we were. The walk back along took us along around surrounded by rice pasture land and two of the great, green mountains as described earlier loomed ominously over us giving a sense that we were walking in a land once great but now lost to history. This feeling was broken by the constant slow of traffic hammering there horns at us. This was no ancient, mythical land. Still just China. We walked back along and paid the ridiculous fee to go into the caves and boy were we surprised; it was like walking into disney land on LSD. The place was lit up with multicoloured lights here, there and everywhere. There were light shows, places to stop to have pictures taken with this like 'lost treasure', 'the ancient sword of old' and 'some dosser in a monkey costume'. It was all rather beautiful, the rock structures, not the light show, and I was willing to over look all the Chinese touristy stuff in favor of the amazing natural beauty of the place. That was until the projection show. I was standing looking with a glaze in my eye only of which can be produced be a perfect mirror image of yourself on gleaming, clear expanse of water when I noticed the reflection of a rather unruly Tyrannosaurus rex sharing the moment with me. They essentially played Jurassic park meets the 'beginnings of man' via a giant projector on the roof of the cave. What a load ofAs we left we did have a lovely tea ceremony in the tourist village out back. They excepted us to buy some tea in return but little did they know were all poor. The teas were all rather delicious but I could not help but be cynical about the sanitary conditions of the tea waterfall which appeared to be housing fish but were lumps of grime. After this darling, free, ceremony we headed back to the hostel and, once more, had a great time amongst friends. The food in Guilin was fairly varied but still to a good standard. We spent a lot of time roaming between very nice coffee shops with good western food but, again, nothing out standing come to mind. No meals stood out particularly really except the last one; on our last night we decided to all have a banquet together as, after this, we would all be going our separate ways, which was rather sad. Gathered round that table eating dishes of food which we didn't quite know what was in them I felt very at home in the Project Trust community.  Such a wonderful collection of individuals who have all contributed, some a little, others a lot, to making China a special experience. Chin Chin. Cheers. Thank you lady Anya and the gentlemen. You're all wonderful.The last day in Guilin we were out of the hostel just in time to head to the train station were Me, Tim, the Stephens and Dan would be heading to Xi'an leaving Alex, Anya and Jacob behind. Good bye my friends (not quite, Alex is going to Newcastle Uni so I think I will be seeing a lot of him).And there we have Guilin. Another leg on what has been an absolutely incredible journey. I will admit there's more of Guilin we could have seen; we could have gone out to the rice paddies, sailed down the river or seen the elephant leg rock structure but you know what? I'm more than happy I did not. I met a lot of wonderful people in Guilin, shared some great times with friends and even made some new ones along the way. The hostel was also a fantastic part of Guilin and really did make it special for us. Goodbye Guilin. You helped build my character up to aid the next part of my journey which marks the subtitle 'The end of what has been the best few weeks of my life' but to read about that be sure to checkout the final part of my Spring festival blogs 'Xi'an: return of the drunken jedi',Until next time beloved readers,Excelsior!"
"Efter varme Kunming gik turen mod Guilin, der BURDE have vaeret varm. MEN noget daerligt (lorte dumt) uvejr har ramt sydkina, saa dagen, hvor vi ankom var der ikke mere end 9-10 grader - hvorimod der havde vaeret 27 dagen foer!! Ikke tilfreds Kina - ikke tilfreds!Men vi ankom d. 5. tidligt om morgenen til vores hostel og fik at vide, ""hmm i kan foerst komme ind paa vaerelset om 6 timer"". Igen ikke tilfreds. Saa vi satte vores ting paa hostelet og gik ud for at faa 6 timer til at gaa.Vi tog ud til Reed Flute Cave, som er en stor klippehule eller drypstenshule med en masse kunstigt farverigt lys indeni. (Kina passer ikke saa godt paa sine naturskatte, hvilket var meget tydeligt.)Dagen efter stod i risens tegn, da vi skulle ud og se paa risterasser - Longji riceterrace. Selvom vejret var daarligt og der var lovet meget faa grader og en smule regn. Paa vejen derud gaar det langsomt op for os HVOR daerligt vejret er, da der er virkelig skyet og diset. Men vi ankommer til de smukke ubeplantede risterasser og gaer rundt blandt dem og proever at tage billeder, selvom vejret er meget imod os. :-( Da vi kommer op paa toppen af en af terasserne er det saa diset, at vi knap kan se ud over de andre rismarker. Virkelig aergeligt, da det kunne have vaeret et virkeligt smukt syn! Ikke tilfreds Kina - ikke tilfreds!"
"Hallo bloggen:)Vi er i hjembyen til vÃ¥r nye venn Chin.Endelig er vi pÃ¥ landet:) Utsikten er hÃ¸ye fjell og ris Ã¥kere med noen smÃ¥ kinesere i:) Diverse ting vi har funnet pÃ¥ her er natt teater med lys show, fisking med hjelp av fugler, sykkeltur rundt pÃ¥ landet, besÃ¸kt risbÃ¸nder, besteget moon hill mountain, gjÃ¸rmebadet i grotter, middag hjemme hos Chin sin familie hvor jeg spiste hund for fÃ¸rste gang og vi hadde oss en fuktig kveld med beerpong:) Man mÃ¥ bare elske denne lille byen. Yangshou er pÃ¥ min topp 10 liste;) Det vÃ¦rste er at hund smaker godt:)"
"One on the bus she told us that we had to pay for the bus that is inside the park an extra charge and then also pay another Â£6.50 for a show by a long haired tribe. We didn't want to but you don't really get given a choice so we paid that too. The woman told us that in this long haired tribe all the girls have hair that is around 2 meters long. Also when they go to the toilet they go outside and use newspaper to cover their faces so people can't tell who they are. But that would totally not work because you can tell who someone is even if you can't see their face. They also pinch bums if they like someone. And that's all I really remember.  We got to the terraces and jumped on a park bus but it was full. So our guide left me and Dan with a different guide and then just got on the full bus without us. We waited around not really knowing what we were meant to do as the new guise had run off. When he finally appeared and then we joined a new group onto a park bus. This guide had better English so it wasn't so bad. We arrived at the long haired tribes village or fake village I'm not really sure and looked in a house. Then went to go see the show. At the start basically all they did was show they long hair whilst singing that sounded like dying cats. Just because they had long hair didn't mean that they could sing. So they really shouldn't have. Then after this they picked men from the audience to go up. We had a camera crew in ours with a presenter so he got picked and two other Chinese. They then asked for a Westerner, there were 3 including Dan. There was an awkward moment where none wanted to go up, and there was absolutely no way on earth that they were going to pick Dan. I could see it in his face. Eventually an older Australian guy took one for the team and went up. First they had to pick a girl and then pound some rice or something. Then go put a costume on and sing a love song to their bride. This was followed by some okie kokie dance and some bum pinching from the women. It was so cringeworthy and horrible and because we had a presenter there being filmed it seemed to go on forever. And we had paid for this horrible show!! Finally the show was over and we had to wait a good 30 mins for our bus to arrive. Then we were on to the longji rice terraces. We climbed a big hill and ate at a restaurant, the specialities were bamboo chicken and bamboo rice. In which the chicken was cooked in the middle of a bamboo pole. We got it and it was horrible. The cuts of meat were things we would there away at home and we couldn't eat some much of it as it was mostly bone that it felt like we left more food then we had started with. The rice was nice though! We then climbed even higher to go see the terraces which after everything although looked pretty we didn't really care about anymore.  Each season they look different. In spring is best as they are filled with water and look really cool, summer they are green, autumn yellow and winter just snow on them. In longji as they have been carved into the  hills I guess a few hundred years ago they gave a really cool formation which is why people go there. The time of year we went was early autumn so the colours were green turning to yellow. We sat there and looked at the view because we were tired and it was hot. And we wished that we hadn't bothered going to this tour at all. After we got a coach to Guilin where we were getting a night train. The coach said it dropped us near the train station but this other backpacker said she knew the way and we followed her which was a mistake as she got us all lost and a 5 min walk turned into a 40 min journey through Guilin carrying our backpacks. We got the train in good time though and it was a nice one as we had nice people to share with. It was our most comfortable and cleanest train journey. Save the best till last I guess!!"
I am having to remember this day some time after the event as the app on my phone has decided not to work and my posts are saved on there.Anyway on this day we visited the paddy fields in Long Ji.  This was an amazing place. We had a long ride to the place and then another 50 minute coach ride from the bottom up to the entrance.  Needless to say we then had to walk up the mountain which was just a path at first. We soon came to steps.  Along the route were vari...
"We set alarms for 7 am knowing we were being picked up at 8 am. It wasn't pleasant! I threw on the clothes I was wearing yesterday and packed my things before heading to the lounge area. Mel ate some breakfast but it was still too early for me so I stuck to some water! We payed for the extra nights we had stayed and then bumped into Irish conor. He may tell a lot of tall tales but it he is pretty funny! Angela was going on the li river tour also, the lady who lef..."
Dag 15 GuilinOnze laatste dag in Guilin. Niets op de planning dus geen haast om op te staan. Nog snel een laatste GRATIS was in de machine gedaan. Wachtend op het eindsignaal hebben we voor de laatste keer genoten van het uitgebreide hostel-ontbijt waarbij we deze keer zo pienter waren de oatmeal niet weg te laten maar om te wisselen voor vers fruit.Ons doel van de dag was de 'Flute Cave'. Makkelijk te bereiken met de stadsbus (1Â¥).- Irritatie 1: de Chines...
"Our last week on mainland China was spent in the beautiful Guangxi province, in southern China, famous for its striking, karst scenery - which is best explained by our pictures! This was the China we knew of from pictures before arriving - stunning rice terraces with views to match, impressive limestone peaks in lush valleys, rice farmers working away in straw hats, bamboo rafts gliding along shimmering riversâ¦.and all felt another world away from what we had seen in China so far.We set off from Guilin - a small and pretty city which provided a good gateway for further treks out - for a night in the village of Tiantouzhai, a village set up high amongst the Longi - or 'Dragon's Backbone' - Rice Terraces. These rice terraces are a beautiful 3-hour drive through huge peaks and hairpin turns, and reach up to 1000m high. We knew the steep 40-minute climb up these terraces to the village where we were staying would probably be a tough one in the June heat, however I don't think we have ever sweated so much, and had to wait outside our guest house to 'drip off' before finding our room.  Luckily it was all worth it as the view from where we were staying was absolute stunning, and despite the heat it was a good time to go as the rice fields seemed to sparkle in front of us after the summer rains in May. The guest houses and village buildings dotted amongst the terraces look like Swiss chalets, all wooden structures perched on the hill slopes - and some snow would certainly have been welcome to cool us down. Once the heat of the day had subsided we went off exploring further up just before sunset, to admire the panoramic view of the shimmering terraced paddy fields around us - unfortunately the blog's Photography Director (Simon) forgot the camera battery back in Guilin, so there were a lot of mental photos being taken and don't be surprised if some of our pictures look like they have been uploaded from the internetâ¦it was too beautiful a sight to not try and share it!Most locals here are Zhuang or Yao people, where traditional dress (for the women anyway) seems to consist of extremely long hair, wrapped high upon their head several times round like a turban, and earlobe-stretching rings in their ears.  The women are also absolutely tiny yet put all the tourists to shame by acting as porters up to the villages (I guess their husbands are busy in the rice fields) carrying what looks like double their weight on their back, up these incredibly steep slopes, while both Chinese and foreign tourists are literally limping and wilting - without their bags - behind them. Yet these were some of the most beautiful, smiley people we had seen so far, and I think we would have felt too guilty paying them to carry our backpacks so were very relieved we had packed lightly and could manage our own bag, even if it meant we weren't supplementing their income. The other thing we wished we could have taken a photo of is the well-dressed Chinese lady who was carried up, I kid you not, in what looked like a rustic chaise-longe, by four men, while she happily sang away (yes) and they struggled with this people carrier up the hill.Next stop was Yangshuo, a smaller and even prettier town near both the Li and Yulong Rivers, and where the surrounding scenery - more peaks and shimmering rivers - was even more impressive. We stayed in a beautiful farmhouse-turned-guesthouse outside of town, surrounded by lush vegetation and chickens hopping about, with a constant orchestra of crickets and frogs filling the air. We spent a blissful four nights here, exploring the local area by bike, going for cooling dips in the river before sunset, watching women take their buffaloes for dips in the water (different river to us luckily), and taking in the amazing scenery with a different perspective from a bamboo raft.We had a great day out on a 6-hour bike ride with a local tour guide, Shandy, and her husband, a Russian-Jewish baker, who were both interesting company and great guides, taking us off-road and on a route we never would have been able to find ourselves: through little villages and fields, over tiny bridges, to caves and then to a local primary school where the school kids were certainly not shy and took great delight in creeping up behind us and suddenly whacking us all on our bums, as you do. We loved exploring by bike, and despite aching backsides (from cycling not the over enthusiastic school children) Simon and I went out again the next day by ourselves, to cycle to Dragon's Bridge, a scenic point a few kms away where you can then take a more leisurely route back, by putting your bikes on the back of a bamboo raft and then be punted down the river and back homeâ¦.a well-deserved rest and once you get through the crowds of Chinese tourists also on bamboo rafts, who love taking pictures of us, shouting ""HELLO!"" and using their 'supersoaker' water pistols on us, it is then a very peaceful and magical float down the river amongst beautiful countryside.It wasn't all a bed of roses though: I have never been a natural at off-road cycling, and it has never been more obvious than over these couple of days.  The day before I managed to veer off one of the narrower paths and careered head first into a ditch - luckily I landed in soft vegetation so no damage done, and Simon managed to have enough time to take a photo (after checking I was ok, of course) before pulling me and the bike out of the ditch, and we laughed at the thought of anyone seeing me as I know it would have been quite a sight. The next day my tumble wasn't so hidden from view: after a torrential downpour we had a tricky path over rocks and mud, and I was feeling very wobbly after a few near misses, and then when I braked too sharply alongside a rice paddy I subsequently face-planted into the field right in front of some local villagers and school kids. This time I wasn't so amused, having landed on all fours in muddy water, my face hot with embarrassment and sweat, and on this occasion Simon wisely decided that taking a photo was not a good idea, so luckily no photo evidence of that one.Cycling mishaps aside, this area was probably the highlight of our month in China, but it would be fair to say we loved all of China - it was certainly far easier to travel around than we thought, the history and culture are fascinating and there are some amazing sights.  The people are also both interesting and amusing in equal measure: we loved their shouty comms (are they angry, are they jokingâ¦who knows?), their habit of squatting everywhere (not just over the hole-in-the-ground toilets), the trend for couples to wear matching t-shirtsâ¦ and they seem to find us as curious, judging by the amount of photos we were asked to be in.  We were also pleasantly surprised by the food, which is totally unlike Chinese food back in the UK, and we seemed to avoid any major mishaps (eg ordering a male animal's certain gland) - probably due to the helpful picture menus, as opposed to our master of Mandarin. And finally, it's probably a good thing that our skills - or lack of - with chopsticks will get further practice when we re-enter China after a couple of months in South East Asia, and on our way to Central Asia (as the plan currently stands).Until next timeâ¦and thank you to all those who have left messages and comments, we love every one and love hearing from people following our trip with us!

"Beth, Cat and I arrived in Guilin on Monday morning. Our hostel was only a short walk from the train station so we should have been there within twenty minutes of leaving the train but, because we're idiots, we walked straight past it and instead spent a good hour hauling all of our bags several kilometres down the road. Everybody we asked for directions would point in different directions and suggest random arrival times, including the receptionist at a hotel which later turned out to be directly opposite our hostel. Brilliant. We eventually gave in and caught a cab to the hostel all the way back along the road we'd just struggled down. Our friend Kaye, who we'd met whilst staying at the Lazybones hostel in Chengdu, where he works, was waiting for us when we arrived and the four of us settled down in front of the hostel TV to wait for Hannah, who was due to arrive around lunch-time.That afternoon was spent wandering relaxedly around Guilin city centre. Rob and Dan had visited Guilin about two weeks earlier and passed our phone numbers on to some of the friends they'd made and one of these friends, a tour-guide called Jane, got in touch with us to offer to show us around the city. First she took us to a busy undergound market because Beth, Cat and I had decided we wanted our ears piercing again; we found a tiny tattoo-piercing parlour and each forked out 10Y (yes, that is Â£1) to have our tragus pierced. It sounds very dodgy but it was all clean and as professional as anything ever is here. We may have been fighting ear infections of varoius intensities ever since, but I think this is more our fault for keeping jumping in dirty rivers and stuff than anything else. Next on our tour was going to be the famous two pagodas on the lake, but we were distracted by a bargainous pizza stand so stopped for lunch instead. Jane didn't have time to stay with us after this, but she pointed us in the right direction and we strolled along the promenade by the river, in the sun, until we reached them. We were waylaid en-route by an enormous tour group wanting dozens of photos together with us, which was about 50:50 funny and embarrassing, but we escaped easily enough into the skinny band of parkland which surrounds the pagodas and the lake they're set upon. This was all very pretty, especially with the blue skies we had that day, so we had a pleasant stroll about taking photos and haggling with the souvenir ladies before we headed back to the hostel again.The rest of our party weren't due to arrive until late that evening, so we set about planning the next day's excursion to the Longji rice terraces whilst we waited. I don't know how we'd have managed without Kaye; because we were trying to save money by co-ordinating the trip ourselves, we had to go to the train station to hire a private bus, explain our plans, haggle about prices... which was all infinitely easier when we had someone fluent in Chinese with us! (Arranging things ourselves was worth-while, as it was 100Y cheaper than it would have been to go through the hostel.) Dinner that night was traditional Guilin rice noodles, but not before I'd been accosted on the street whilst trying to buy some fruit. I'd just paid for a little plastic bowl of watermelon chunks to snack on when a guy popped up on my right, grabbed my little bowl, stabbed a piece of watermelon on a cocktail stick and then offered it up to me... I tried to politely decline, but he seemed to be working on the fruit stall too and he was pretty insistent, so in the end I just let him feed me the bloody watermelon. Then he speared another piece of watermelon and offered me that too, and I can't remember if it was at this chunk or the next that I realised I was in danger of being fed the whole bowl piece by piece and snatched my watermelon back, but when I did this guy just trotted back off into the crowd. He didn't work on the fruit stall, he didn't even know the owner... apparently he was just a random guy who spotted an opportunity to be weird and seized it.Nold, Alex, Naomi, Pete and Henry arrived at around midnight that night. We stayed up for a while to catch up, but we took the turning off of all the lights in the bar area as a hint that we ought to go to bed and peeled off.Next morning half of us were up early to catch the first of the minivans we'd hired to go to the rice terraces. The second bus would leave later because it would wait for Bertie, the last of our party, to arrive that morning but in the end we arrived only about an hour apart from each other. This was all thanks to our driver, who had decided to bring his girlfriend along for a day-trip and wanted to do so without her actually paying for a ticket. I think he was hoping she could slip in amidst all of us and the guards wouldn't notice that our group was one ticket short but this was a stupid idea and obviously it didn't work. He bickered with the guard checking our tickets for a while, then drove the van back into the car-park, parked and disappeared. His girlfriend waited silently in the van for a bit, then she disappeared too, although we would see one or the other of them pop up somewhere across the car-park every now and then. I don't know how long we waited, but it was too long. After a while the driver reappeared, sans girlfriend, and we finally made it to the furthest collection of rice terraces, which are apparently the largest in the world. We had a plain lunch together in the little minority village at the foot of the terraces whilst we waited for the second minivan to arrive, and then we set off to hike up through the terraces to a peak from which we'd be able to overlook them all.I'll try to upload photos of the rice terraces soon because I don't know how well I can describe them. I think the most impressive part of the terraces is just the scale of them - whichever way you look, for as far as you can see, every hillside has been clipped into dozens and dozens of meandering grassy shelves. It was nice to be doing something that felt like exercise after being cooped up on trains and buses so much, and it also didn't feel too touristy, which was a really welcome change from the majority of our travelling thus far. Maybe because we'd gone to the furthest set of terraces, there were practically no other visitors and no garish souvenir shops, just the odd local woman in a traditional head-dress and Nike trainers wandering about with a woven basket of post-card and scarves to sell.For our last night in Guilin, we found a stall in the night market where we could sit outside and eat street food. We had spicy sea-snails and mini-lobsters, skewers of squid and eel, whole barbecued fish on sticks, garlic oysters... all of it really good and really cheap. After dinner we wandered back through the market and to the hostel, where we played foosball and chatted with the hostel staff who were really cool. One guy, Yang, had taught himself a British accent by listening to football commentaries, and we were trying to help him perfect his pronunciation of several of the key British phrases Dan had taught him when he'd visited the week before. For example: """"d'you wanna take this outside mate?"" ""innit"" and ""I'll shank you bled!"""
"Guilin is a lovely small and scenic city by the Li river, surrounded by sharply protruding (and very beautiful) hills. The small lakes (picture) in the middle are surrounded by little walkways along the banks which are shaded by foliage which is mostly made up of 'osmanthus' trees. The Chinese word for these trees is ""Gui"" and ""Lin"" means forest - so Guilin means forest of osmanthus trees. It is a very relaxing place and everyone is very friendly. I've been on a couple of day trips here. Yesterday (Sunday) we cruised down the Li river whilst taking in the fantastic and famous scenery (the picture on a 20 Yuan note is a view from this river). We ended up at Yangshuo where I went on a bamboo raft to watch some cormorant fishing and sit on a water buffalo. The cormorants have been trained for years to catch fish and then return to their owner who pulls it out their mouth. They hold the fish in their throat but can't swallow if it's a big fish because the owner has tied some string around the birds neck, restricting the width of the throat.On Saturday we went to the Longji rice terraces. Looked around the little village on the hill which had random animals running round the tiny streets. Some guy filmed us as we ate some 'special and unique' rice which tasted the same as any other rice. He was making a documentary about White people eating rice - I think he just wanted to video us trying to use chopsticks. Earlier on we also saw some women with hair down to their feet. These women are part of a minority group called Yao, they don't cut their hair until they get married and then they grow it again (I don't think it's all Yao women who do this - there are over 2 million Yao people in china all living in mountain villages across south China). They have three different hairstyles which indicate whether they are single, married without children, or married with children. We watched them wash their hair in water that has been used to wash rice. Stupid tourists paying money to watch people wash their hair, what an easy way to make money! After the rice terraces we also went to a tea plantation and tried osmanthus flower tea (lady's tea), Jasmine tea and lychee tea, all very nice.  We were also given a lesson on how to make perfect tea from a woman in an elegant pink uniform.Near the city there are also some incredible caves full of stallic tights an stallic mites. Everywhere you go around here is surrounded by fantastic scenery."
"Zo we're back!Waar moet ik beginnen...te veel gedaan de afgelopen dagen :)!Okay laten we het op chronologische volgorde doen!De laatste dag in Xi'an zijn we naar het terracotta leger geweest! En dat was mijn eerste dag met echte hitte, dat was ff wennen :)! Ik schat zo rond 35+ graden!Anyhow ik zal proberen het beknopt te houden...terug naar het leger!Het leger was tof en GROOT(s) een van de vroegere keizers heeft dit leger laten bouwen voor zijn eigen hiernamaals...er hebben 700.000 mensen voor 38 jaar aan gewerkt...duizenden levensgrote beelden van soldaten (elk persoon een ander gezicht en lichaam), paarden, gebouwen, wachten, gereedschappen, wapens, etc...alles wat hij in zijn eigen leven ook had! Super indrukwekkend!Okay beknopt...next -> Guilin!Hier zijn we naartoe gevlogen, eerste indruk was, kermis, kerst, lichtjes, bah! Maar de omgeving is zo vet! We zijn de eerste dag naar de Longji rijstvelden gegaan bij Dazhai! Ik had nog nooit een rijstveld gezien, maar het is zo vet!En we waren met leuke mensen. En ze bestaan, leuke Russen!We hebben zelfs een slaapplek in Moskou mochten we daar nog ooit komen!De dag erna het volgende avontuur, op een bamboo raft (gewoon een bootje met motortje) over de ""Li river""WTF het landschap is hier A-DEM-BE-NE-MEND!!! De foto's ga ik zo uploaden!Doen de panorama foto's het eigenlijk op een PC?Okay next, we zijn nu in Yangshuo, iets zuidelijker dan Guilin aan de Li river. En ons hotel heeft een dakterras over dit adembenemend landschap! Gisteren gechillt en vandaag gefietst naar de ""moonhill""! 800 treden in de vochtige hitte omhoog lopen is zwaar! But it was worth it! Schitterend uitzicht!Ow de moonhill is een berg met een gat erin...die gezien kan worden als een volle maan! Vandaar de naam!Van daar uit hebben we rond gefietst langs de yulong river...ik denk dat ik daar het meest authentieke stukje China tot nu toe heb gezien! Mensen die puur van de natuur leven...en het mooie gebergte, rijstvelden, buffels...woaw!!! Foto's komen zo!Ow wacht dat was het tot nu toe...volgende locatie moet nog bepaald worden!To be continued!"
"Rob and I finish teaching later than the rest of our travelling group and as a result we would be missing out a chunk of the South China travelling. This balanced out with us having extra time off for exams before the end of term so we visited Guilin ourselves; an area of China so beautiful that it features on the back of the Y20 note. We left on the Friday for the 4 and a half hour bus to Nanchang followed by a twelve hour overnight train to Guilin. The train was a pretty short one by China terms but it was not a good journey. I had the middle seat so no window to lean on, no aisle space to stretch legs or have an easy exit and crammed between two people with only a tiny bit of table to lean on. I was opposite the world's grumpiest old man and enjoyed a very uncomfortable night of no sleep.  We arrived at 05:30 in the morning and misread the directions to the hostel so took a nice long detour with our bags. We chilled at the hostel for a bit then decided to work out a plan of action; we had literally no idea what there was to do in Guilin, deciding instead to wing it and see what the hostel recommended. We took a bus to Reed Flute Cave which was beautiful but very similar to the other caves we've visited. We spent the afternoon playing a bit of Mario Kart in the hostel and chatting to the staff who became our best friends pretty much straight away. In the afternoon Crystal, from the hostel, took us for a walk to the market which turned out to be an 8 storey department store. We rode the escalators all the way to the top floor to buy Rob shampoo then all the way down again. Maybe we should have rounded off a successful day with catching up on our sleep ready for our tour the next day but we met two Irish lads in the hostel and drank with them and Yang and ended up going out for spicy barbequed fish and a night of clubbing until the early hours. Better than sleep.  The next morning we were ready for 10 for a trip to Yangshuo and a cruise on the Li river organised by the hostel and we quickly found we'd unintentionally signed onto a proper tour which we try and avoid because they're expensive and annoying. The plan of catching up on sleep on the bus was foiled by our tour guide YangYang/Daniel talking the entire way but it was informative. We went straight to the start of the cruise with 4 to a boat on motorised 'bamboo' boats made from PVC. This was a nice trip winding down the river and seeing all the scenery that Guilin is famous for. Would have been better if it was properly sunny but apart from a light shower it wasn't too bad. The end of the boat ride signalled the end of the tour that we'd paid for but we chose to pay an extra Y130 for an extended tour in the afternoon because it was good value and we'd get to tick off everything in one day and go back to Guilin. Our tour group shrank to 3 Germans, an Argentinian and the Chinese people and we went for egg fried rice before being whisked off to a famous bridge to take photos. On the bridge I met Jane, a trainee tour guide who happened to come from the same province as us and after this we were taken down to proper bamboo rafts to be poled down the river. We stopped off on a outcrop of land where we spent a little while feeding and riding the water buffalo then went back on the raft to have a long, soothing journey down the river. The peace was occasionally interrupted by splashes from water guns from other rafts but this was nice because it was so hot. We got the bus back to Guilin and made good friends with Jane who would keep us company on some other days. We met a cool Indonesian couple each studying in London and New York and taught them how to play mahjiang in exchange for learning Chinese chess and we played these until the early hours.  We left Monday for a trip to the rice terraces but unfortunately Rob woke up really ill so had to stay at the hostel. I set off on my own and caught up on sleep on the bus to HePing then met two friendly Canadian couples on the bus to Ping'An. I latched on to their recently formed group (they'd only met on the bus before!) and we spent the day together walking the rice terraces and taking photos. They were absolutely beautiful, basically paddy fields cut into the sides of the mountains and we saw lots of local women who still wore their hair in the traditional fashion - extremely long and wound around their head. We timed things absolutely perfectly and managed to make both viewing point and arrive back on the dot for the bus. To do this we had to sacrifice food though and I had only had an apple for breakfast. We had plans with Jane that night to go out and sample Guilin's traditional dish; beer duck. The woman brought through a wriggling duck in a net and we waited while it was killed and cooked. Unfortunately Rob was still too ill to eat much and Jane wasn't hungry so I had to make the most of the Y200 meal - pricey! The beer duck didn't really taste different to normal duck by the way.  I stayed up late playing Mario Kart with our Indonesian friends and then drank beer with Yang while we taught each other our own languages. At some point we were joined by a two guys from Hong Kong and Turkey and before we knew it was 05:30â¦ Had a chill night though. Met Jane again on Tuesday and we went on a boat trip around Guilin and saw the Sun and Moon Pagodas. Then it was time to get the train home which was delayed a bit but a very relaxed journey. Only 16 hours and we had beds so very comfortable!  Guilin was a great place to visit and absolutely beautiful!"
"Hey everyoneWe have just arrived very late into Guilin after missing two pre booked trains and frantically getting a five hour bus to Changsha, and then 14 hours in a 3rd Class train cabin with 60 other people all crammed in. We have now seen the best and worst of Chinese transport. Luke and I had two top bunks, there were two below us and we couldn't even roll over. Oh well it was an experience and only cost 13 pounds each.We were woken up in Guilin at 7pm..."
"19/3 Varje dag Ã¤r ett Ã¤ventyr i Kina. Nu har Julia insjuknat, spydde slutet av bussresan igÃ¥r frÃ¥n Nanning tiÃ¶Ã¶ Yangshou och sedan fortsatte det, kvÃ¤llen och hela natten. Vi tror att det Ã¤r en blandning mellan olika saker, Mcdonalds mat de senaste dagarna som enda "" nÃ¤ringsgivare"" och ngn bakterie som lockat sig till hennes mun. Emma upptÃ¤ckte tyvÃ¤rr, eller det var VERKLIGEN TUR att hon upptÃ¤ckte men hade varit bÃ¤st om det inte fanns ngt att upptÃ¤cka, att mitt och hennes visum nÃ¤mligen gÃ¥r ut tre dagar innan Vi planerat att lÃ¤mna Kina. Julia och Erika har av ngn okÃ¤nd och mystik anledning fÃ¥tt 60 dagars visum medan Emma och jag fÃ¥tt 30! Vi ansÃ¶kte om 30 men personen pÃ¥ fÃ¶retaget ""Alla visum"" sa till Julia nÃ¤r hon frÃ¥gade om det verkligen rÃ¤ckte med 30 dagars visum Ã¤ven om vi Ã¤r dÃ¤r ytterligare nÃ¥gra dagar, sa att sÃ¥ lÃ¤nge vi Ã¤r ute ur Kina inom 40 dagar sÃ¥ Ã¤r det lugnt!! Vilket Ã¤r SKITSNACK!! NÃ¤r man gÃ¥r till ett fÃ¶retag, betalar 500 spÃ¤nn extra sÃ¥ fÃ¶rvÃ¤ntar mig sig sjÃ¤lvklart att de ger en rÃ¤tt information!!!AlltsÃ¥, GÃ INTE TILL "" ALLA VISUM"" PÃ KUNGSGATAN  I STOCKHOLM utan gÃ¥ direkt till varje enskild ambassad, lite osmidigare men du sparar pengar och du stÃ¶djer dÃ¥ inte ett fÃ¶retag som inte vet vad de sÃ¤ger eller gÃ¶r och tar dubbelt sÃ¥ mkt i betalt Ã¤n vad ambassaden gÃ¶r, att fortsÃ¤tta sin verksamhet. Den lilla felinformationen som de gav oss har gjort allting betydligt mer komplicerat Ã¤n vad vi tÃ¤nkte att ansÃ¶ka via dem skulle ge. SÃ¥klart Ã¤r det slarvigt frÃ¥n vÃ¥r sida att inte kolla upp det mer men man man litar sÃ¥klart pÃ¥ mÃ¤nniskor som arbetar med ansÃ¶kningar om visum till kina varje dag! SÃ¥ idag fick ja veta att fÃ¶r att ansÃ¶ka om fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngt visum mÃ¥ste jag Ã¥ka till grannstaden Guilin, och vÃ¤l dÃ¤r gÃ¥ till polisavdelningen som har hand om visum applikationer. Emma har ombokningsbar flygbilj sÃ¥ hon bestÃ¤mde sig fÃ¶r att boka om flyget till 14 april ist fÃ¶r den 18:e som vi redan har bilj till, men eftersom jag har en icke  ombokningsbar 3000 kronors biljett till New Delhi dn 18:e och icke ombokningsbart hotell fÃ¶r tvÃ¥ nÃ¤tter ser jag gÃ¤rna att jag fÃ¥r fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngt visum. Erika var jÃ¤ttesnÃ¤ll och fÃ¶ljde med mig till Gulin medan Emma var hemma och sÃ¥g efter Julia. SÃ¥klart hade vi oturen att hamna pÃ¥ ngn lokalbuss som stannade lite nÃ¤r den kÃ¤nde fÃ¶r det, och en chauffÃ¶r som rÃ¶kte och petade sig i bÃ¥de nÃ¤san och Ã¶ronen hela vÃ¤gen. Han var en riktig koala och bussresan tog nÃ¤rmare 2 h ist fÃ¶r ca 1 h..VÃ¤l framme i Gulin tar vi en taxi till applikationscentret och stÃ¤ller oss i kÃ¶. NÃ¤r det Ã¤r min tur ger jag fram formulÃ¤ret om fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngning av visum och mitt pass och jag fÃ¶rklarar min situation. Hon sÃ¤ger dÃ¥ att1: jag mÃ¥ste bo pÃ¥ ett hotell i Guilin fÃ¶r att kunna ansÃ¶ka om fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngt visum hÃ¤r.2: mÃ¥ste ha ett kontoutdrag som bevisar att jag har Ã¶ver 18 000 kr pÃ¥ konto3: passfoto4: kopia pÃ¥ bÃ¥de visum och pass.Jag kÃ¤nner bara hur jag sakta men sÃ¤kert sjunker under jorden(iaf metalt) eftersom jag pratar med en kvinnlig polis i ett kommunistiskt och diktatoriskt land vet jag att det inte Ã¤r lÃ¤ge att argumentera emot utan bara le sÃ¶tt och sÃ¤ga "" okej utmÃ¤rkt, ja fixar"". Jag gÃ¥r sedan ut och sÃ¤ger till Erika "" hur i helvete ska vi kunna hitta ett stÃ¤lle som kopierar, kan skriva ut frÃ¥n dator och tar passfoton! Att varenda liten affÃ¤r eller hÃ¥l i vÃ¤ggen i hela Gulin endast har skyltar pÃ¥ kinesiska gÃ¶r allting inte lÃ¤ttare. DÃ¥ ser vi en kopieringsmaskin i en affÃ¤r pÃ¥ andra sidan gatan, vi har ingen aning om vad det Ã¤r fÃ¶r affÃ¤r dÃ¥ som sagt, det stÃ¥r pÃ¥ kinesiska, men vi kommer in och vi ser oss lite fÃ¶rvirrade omkring och dÃ¥ sÃ¤ger plÃ¶tsligt en man ""photo photo... Oh gestikulerar, vi nickar och han pekar runt ett hÃ¶rn, vi gÃ¥r runt hÃ¶rnet och hittar lite lÃ¤tt fÃ¶rvÃ¥nade en fotostudio. Jag tar av mig jackan, sÃ¤tter mig pÃ¥ stolen, fÃ¥r hÃ¥rslingorna tillrÃ¤ttalagda, blir blÃ¤ndad av en blixt och fÃ¥r sedan fyra passfoton utskrivna. LÃ¤tt och smidigt(fÃ¶r en gÃ¥ng skull). Sedan gÃ¥r jag och stÃ¤ller mig vid kopieringsmaskinen och tar fram mitt pass och pekar pÃ¥ passet och sedan pÃ¥ maskinen. Mannen vid maskinen bÃ¶rjar kopiera allting. (Dubbletter) lika bra att ha extra om ngt hÃ¤nder, ber honom kopiera mitt Indien visum ocksÃ¥. Nu har vi p****t av tvÃ¥ saker pÃ¥ listan. Bara tvÃ¥ saker kvar. Vi gÃ¥r till ett kafÃ©, tar varsin cappuccino, och tÃ¤nker...Boende..hmm...  Jag har inte lust att Ã¶vernatta sjÃ¤lv i Guilin(och eftersom Erika har lÃ¤mnat passet i Yangshou sÃ¥ kan hon inte Ã¶vernatta med mig). Vi frÃ¥gar kvinnan pÃ¥ kafÃ©t om det finns ngt hotell i nÃ¤rheten. Hon nickar och sÃ¤ger att hon visar oss dit, tyvÃ¤rr kostade det 141 kr/natt, lite fÃ¶rdyrt. Vi bÃ¶rjar gÃ¥ tillbaka dÃ¥ jag kommer pÃ¥ att en bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelse pÃ¥ att jag ska checka in idag pÃ¥ ett hotell hÃ¤r Guilin borde rÃ¤cka. Det var nÃ¤mligen en bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelse som vi hade skickat med vÃ¥r ansÃ¶kan i Sverige nÃ¤r vi behÃ¶vde ange boende i Kina. Jag bokar dÃ¥ ett hostel, backstreet youth hostel, en natt. Sedan frÃ¥gar vi kvinnan frÃ¥n kafÃ©t om hon vet var jag skulle kunna skriva ut lite papper. Efter lite gestikulering fÃ¶rstÃ¥r hon och Ã¤nnu en gÃ¥ng vÃ¤gen. Vet inte vad vi skull ha gjort utan henne!!. Jag lyckas skriva ut alla papper jag behÃ¶ver genom att gissa mig lite fram. Alting Ã¤r som vanligt pÃ¥ en ofÃ¶rstÃ¥eligt sprÃ¥k men dÃ¥ jag Ã¤r van vid hur PC datorer fungerar sÃ¥ kan jag klicka pÃ¥ lite kinesiska tecken och komma rÃ¤tt.Efter detta var det dags, 1 h senare och 40 min innan applikationscentret stÃ¤nger fÃ¶r dagen att skynda sig dit. SÃ¥klart har jag oturen att hamna i kÃ¶ efter ett en grupp segproppar som jag verkligen funderar Ã¶ver vad i helvete de hÃ¥ller pÃ¥ med. Efter 15 min, fortfarande inte klara och de hade dÃ¥ redan varit dÃ¤r ett tag innan fÃ¶rmodligen. NÃ¤r det kl Ã¤r 17:20, 10 min innan de stÃ¤nger, blir det ÃNTLIGEN min tur. Jag gÃ¥r fram med glatt humÃ¶r men ocksÃ¥ lite nervÃ¶s och otÃ¥lig(fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker dÃ¶lja det sÃ¥ gott som det gÃ¥r)sitter och sliter sÃ¶nder en papperslapp i tusen delar medan kvinnan gÃ¥r igenom alla papper noggrant.""Have patience,please"" helvete heller tÃ¤nker jag tyst fÃ¶r mig sjÃ¤lv, dÃ¥ bÃ¶rjar hon plÃ¶tsligt ifrÃ¥gasÃ¤tta min bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelse pÃ¥ mitt boende i Guilin. Hon sÃ¤ger att hon inte ser i databasen att jag Ã¤r registrerad hÃ¤r utan bara i Yangshou! Jag fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker fÃ¶rklara att jag ska checka Ikv, kl 18:00, som det stÃ¥r, de kommer behÃ¶va behÃ¥lla mitt pass ett par timmar nÃ¤mligen. Hon vÃ¤grar att FATTA(sÃ¥klart', en osammarbetsvillig kvinnlig polis, annat vore konstigt,) "" maybe you should comeback tomorrow"" sÃ¤ger hon sedan, helvete heller att jag tÃ¤nker! jag vill Ã¥ka tillbaka ikv till yangshou(tÃ¤nker jag fÃ¶r mig sjÃ¤lv) och svara med att "" jag ska ju checka inom 30 min, rÃ¤cker inte det med min bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelse? ""Maybe you should comeback tomorrow"", nu bÃ¶rjar vi bÃ¥da bli irriterade och det bÃ¤sta att gÃ¶ra i denna situation egentligen Ã¤r att sÃ¤ga ""okej, kommer imorn ist"" men eftersom jag oftast inte gÃ¶r som man borde gÃ¶ra bÃ¶rjar jag ist att  argumentera emot och fÃ¶rklara att nÃ¤r vi sÃ¶kte visum frÃ¥n Sverige rÃ¤ckte det med en bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelse, det borde gÃ¶ra det nu ocksÃ¥, det Ã¤r ju ingen skilland! ""Did you not understand, maybe you should come back tomorrow"" sÃ¤ger hon, "" men varfÃ¶r rÃ¤cker inte bokningsbekrÃ¤ftelsen, ska ju checka in ikv"" svarar jag med en lÃ¤tt irriterad rÃ¶st! ""Did you not understand, maybe you should come back tomorrow"" sÃ¤ger hon smÃ¥ fÃ¶rbannat. Nu gÃ¥r Erika emellan och sÃ¤ger"" kom nu tess, lÃ¤gg ner, bÃ¤ttre att gÃ¥ hÃ¤rifrÃ¥n"", jag Ã¶ppnar munnen men Erika sÃ¤ger igen "" Tess nu gÃ¥r vi, kom nu!!! Erika gÃ¥r fram till mig och jag gÃ¥r motvilligt dÃ¤rifrÃ¥n och svÃ¤r!!  Om pms kvinnan hade velat hade hon mkt vÃ¤l kunnat skicka vidare min ansÃ¶kan till ambassaden men nepp!! Det var nog tur att Erika var med, annars hade min chans att fÃ¥ ett fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngt visum fÃ¶rmodligen varit utesluten eftersom ag inte hade gett mig fÃ¶rrÃ¤n de slÃ¤ngt ut mig.SÃ¥ jaaa, nu sitter jag hÃ¤r, pÃ¥ backstreet youth hostel, ensam och vÃ¤ntar pÃ¥ bÃ¤ttre dagar. Imorn ska jag gÃ¥ till ambassaden vi 8:30 och visa mitt certifikat pÃ¥ att jag bor pÃ¥ ett hostel i Guilin. Hoppas fÃ¶r gudskull att de godkÃ¤nner min ansÃ¶kan bara. Annars kommer jag nog dra till Malaysia nÃ¥gra dagar ist, de flesta flyg mellanlandar Ã¤ndÃ¥ dÃ¤r innan de flyger vidare till Delhi sÃ¥ dÃ¥ kan jag gÃ¶ra en kort visit i Malaysia(behÃ¶ver inget visum;) DÃ¥ slipper mitt redan bokade hotellrum gÃ¥ till spillo!! Men fÃ¶rhoppningsvis finner inte polismÃ¤nnen, som hanterar min ansÃ¶kan(om jag fÃ¥r den godkÃ¤nd av poliskvinnan fÃ¶rst) som ngn ung studerande upprorsmakare/snokande resande journalist( ngt som kanske dock skulle behÃ¶vas i detta land) tÃ¤nkte att jag skulle informera er lite om hur lÃ¤get Ã¤r hÃ¤r:) annars Ã¤r allting jÃ¤ttebra!! Ãt supergott naanbrÃ¶d idag dÃ¥ det Ã¤r iaf lite positivt:)Uppdaterar senare om hur det gÃ¥r! Pussar och kramar!"
"Hello friends. Our time in mainland China has started off a little slowly as it has been rainy and cold outside. We took the opportunity to stay in our wonderful hotel and do schoolwork for a few days. We are in an area that sees a lot of tourism, most of which is from within China. As foreigners, we are a huge curiousity here (read - stared at constantly). When we called to see if there was a car service offered from the airport to the hotel we didn't even give our names and they knew who we were. Big clue that no other English speaking guests were arriving the same day. They were definitely expecting us! They are curious about us and we are curious about them. This is as foreign as our travels have taken us. There are so many interesting things to sit back and take in. The menu at the hotel restaurant for instance has ""wild cat and snake soup"" listed. I am not that adventurous of an eater, but if I were, I think I might prefer those meats to be in separate soups. Cat soup for lunch and the snake soup for dinner. Actually that doesn't sound much better. We'll pass. Another curiousity for us is the toilet in our hotel room. It has more buttons than the Space Shuttle. You have options for cleaning yourself, drying, deodorizing, heating both the seat and the water for cleaning, on and on. I'm pretty sure there is button to order room service delivery right to the bathroom! We have also enjoyed tuning into the Chinese tv shows. Big toss up which we prefer; game shows that we don't understand or swordfighting dramas that we don't understand. All are entertaining with AG adding his own voiceover. We had a good couple of down days until Celeste couldn't go without chocolate any longer and sent Dad out in the pouring rain to find M&Ms!Today the sun came out and we hired a driver and an English tour guide to take us around Guilin. Guilin is a ""small"" city we have been told by several people, only 700,000 within the city limits and 2 million counting the outskirts - just tiny! Our guide, Sophie, took us first to the Reed Flute Cave. In addition to the cave itself and the lightshow with beautiful Chinese music, there were ancient turtles that we, of course, paid extra to go look at (suckers)! Sure they are over 1300 years old! That really seems possible! My favorite thing about the cave was either a lost in translation thing or a Chinese thing, still deciding. Sophie told us to use our imagination as to what the limestone formations might look like. Then she would ask us our thoughts. We might answer, ""a mushroom"", and she would respond, ""That is an acceptable answer"". We might respond, ""a sleeping dragon"" and she would say, ""No. Keep looking."" This cracked me up. When using your imagination is there a right or wrong answer? Apparently in China there is!Sophie also took us to the government run, Tea Research Institute for a lesson on tea production and a traditional Chinese tea ceremony. We all loved this. White, black, oolong, compressed...we got the skinny! Back in Italy, Anthony said that he would buy each of us a special souvenier anywhere along the trip. I bought a leather jacket before he had the words out of his mouth. Celeste chose a watch and Nina has been holding back, searching for the perfect treat. Today she chose a tea set that is both traditional and very beautiful. If you are ever at our home please have her give you the full tea ceremony treatment!We went to Yao Mountain, the highest of all the mounded peaks in Guilin. Because of all the rain the past few days the views were especially misty and beautiful. We rode the chairlift up and the alpine slide down. If you happen to have ridden an alpine slide with us before and you witnessed both AG and I riding at mach speed, wiping out and limping and bleeding for days afterwards (you know who you are), you will be happy to know that we didn't risk an ER visit in China and behaved on the way down!We had lunch in a local noodle shop that Sophie said she has never taken clients to before, only friends. I felt so honored that she knew we would love eating like the locals. The entire lunch for all 5 of us came to 3 USD. It was delish! Sophie taught us 6 Chinese words today and she quizzed us over lunch. We now know ""yes, no, hello, thank you, mouth and Reed Flute Cave"" (this one might not be particularly useful).To wrap up our day we went on a boat ride down the Li River. We saw many temples, beautiful bridges and locals going about their daily lives.  Tomorrow we take an extended boat tour down the Li River to our next location, Yangshuo. We really like the idea of hiring guides here as we would be otherwise lost. So we have hooked up with a tourguide/couple, Sunny and Andy, I love them just from their names. They are going to show us the sights for the next few days. On the agenda are rice terraces, a bike tour, a bamboo raft ride, and a night water and light show choreographed by the man who put together the opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics. We are looking forward to it all!Amy"
"Nu har vi sagt farvel til middel kolde Shanghai og sagt goddag til varme Guilin. Shaghai er veloverstaaet og vi fik set en masse i den store og befolkningsrige by. Fantastiske udsigter, enorme skyskrabere og en velstand af en helt anden kaliber. (nogle steder). I Shanghai var vi paa ""the bund"" som er en stor havnepromenade der foelger floden i shanghai. Fra ""the bund"" kan man skue ud over det splinter nye shanghai ""Pudong"" som det ogsaa kaldes. Vi var ogsaa paa Shanghais museum for byen fortid, men samtig er det ogsaa et sted hvor de viser visionerne for fremtiden. Alt skal vaere endnu stoerre endnu breddere og noget nyt, mere miljoevenligt. Paa Peoples' square ligger dette museum, samt en park hvori byens borgere, danser om aftenen, tivoli om dagen og samlingsted for traette kinesere til middag - dem som bare vil have en hurtig morfar. Vi var ogsaa ude at se Shanghai stadion og vi gik ned ad deres store, brede nyrenoverede gaagade ()   Men alt i alt, en skide god tur til Shanghai, som boed os paa baade op og nedturer. Vi landede i Guilin 23.30 tirsdag aften, og var foerst paa hostlet 01.00. Et super fint hostel, med et stort vaerelse og super flinker mennesker. Vi har ogsaa smidt de store jakker og satser paa fantastisk vejr. Det tegner rigtig godt. forloebig har vi 2 naetter mere paa vores nuvaerende hostel, saa maa vi se hvad vi goer efterfoelgende. :)"
"Efter utallige farvel middage, et misset tog men vellykket ankomst til Shanghai, er jeg stadig ikke sikker pÃ¥ om familien overhovedet er lettet fra Helsinki, hvor Henrik har skrevet en besked fra om at de er rendt ind i en forsinkelse. SÃ¥ for ikke at stÃ¥ unÃ¸dvendigt tidligt op/til der hvor de burde vÃ¦re kommet, sover jeg lidt videre. Det resulterer i at Henrik pludselig ringer: Vi er i Kina nu, hvor er du? Jeg kommer hu hej ud af dÃ¸ren og med metroen over til pudong, hvor de stÃ¥r af Magleven. Flagene er pakket vÃ¦k i skuffelsen over at jeg ikke stod klar til at modtage dem, men gensynet er dejligt og glÃ¦desfuldt :) Vi tager til det centralt liggende hotel ved Nanjing Lu, og derefter ud for at se lidt pÃ¥ byen.Alle er ret jetlag ramte, sÃ¥ vores vanlige vandren rundt og kigge pÃ¥ utallige ting bliver lidt bremset af den meget gabende og ubestemmende flok. Da vi har set pudong, vandret rundt og taget metroen ned til people square for at se museeumet - ombestemmer os for at se museemet da folk er trÃ¦tte, vil tage tourbussen, men sÃ¥ alligevel ikke, og ender sÃ¥ alligevel med at gÃ¸re det, er alle vidst godt tilfredse da de sidder i bussen med det fÃ¸rste kinesiske mÃ¥ltid - cupnoodles - og ikke behÃ¸ver at tage stilling til meget fra tourbussen. Vi er godt henne af eftermiddagen og smutter ind i et storcenter pÃ¥ Nanjing Lu for at fÃ¥ en kaffe indtil det bliver mÃ¸rkt - synet ned af gaden skulle de bare have! Shanghai kommer til sin ret her ned ad gaden, og alle er glade og forblÃ¸ffede. Da vi nu Ã©r familien Hagen, skal vi da ogsÃ¥ lige fÃ¥ noget ud af de sene aftentimer, og der tager vi op i 'Ã¸loplukkeren' for at se aftenviewet og lysene ud over byen. Pudong er stort og overvÃ¦ldende, men desvÃ¦rre er der sÃ¥ meget 'tÃ¥ge' igennem hullet i Ã¸loplukkeren, sÃ¥ vi kan nÃ¦sten ikke se noget hele vejen ind over bund/central siden. Vi gÃ¥r alle velfortjent i seng - flot klaret program efter en 18 timer flyvetur!!Den 21. stÃ¥r vi op, gÃ¥r i vores lokale 'bager' og smutter sÃ¥ hen pÃ¥ Shanghai Museeum (meget kendt) og ser nogle kulturskatte. Efter det fÃ¥r vi taget en taxa, der sÃ¦tter os af 1-2 km fra skrÃ¦dder stedet, sÃ¥ efter en god gÃ¥tur ender vi da ved vores lille skrÃ¦dder-mall, hvor drengene fÃ¥r mÃ¥lt op :) vi piger syntes jo ogsÃ¥ at det er sjovt at fÃ¥ lidt medbestemmelse, sÃ¥ vi kigger ogsÃ¥ farver og detaljer. I taxaen vÃ¦k fra skrÃ¦dderstedet, kommer jeg pludselig i tanke om, at jeg har glemt min smartphone ved skrÃ¦dderen - selv i Kina er jeg heldig, og de har gemt den til side for mig da jeg kommer rendende tilbage ;D De andre venter ved Yu Garden, hvor vi lige hurtigt stikker hovedet ind og ser den gamle bydel. I Yu Garden bliver vi hurtigt stoppet af en 'frivillig' der er der for at give folk gode oplevelser af Yu Garden, han tager os med op og ser udsigten over stedet i et af husene, som sjovt nok ligger ved siden af en the shop. Vi er godt bevidste om at det var et scam, men syntes ogsÃ¥ de skal prÃ¸ve de forskellige the arter og fÃ¥r en tea ceremony :) Det er sÃ¥ smÃ¥t begyndt at regne og blive sent, sÃ¥ selve the huset ser vi hurtigt og dropper ideen med at gÃ¥ op langs the bund. Problemer med at finde en taxa til hotellet gÃ¸r ogsÃ¥ at vi er lige tids afsted til lufthavnen, hvor vi ydermere bliver smidt fra den ene gate til den anden, og sÃ¥ endda ogsÃ¥ har en 2 timers forsinkelse. Vi ringer til den guide der venter, Lee, og forklarer sagen. Han er kÃ¸rt, sÃ¥ ender med at vente pÃ¥ os i en 4 timer, inden vi er i Guilin ved 1 tiden om natten. Lee virker sÃ¸d og Ã¥ben/sjov, men vi er ikke i mega snakkehumÃ¸r der midt om natten.NÃ¦ste morgen stÃ¥r vi op og fÃ¥r hotellets morgen buffet, mere eller mindre kun til os. Hele turen bÃ¦rer prÃ¦g af, at vi ikke er i hÃ¸jsÃ¦sonen, sÃ¥ der er plads til frygtelig mange mennesker, men er nÃ¦sten ene ude og se tingene. Taget i sammenligning med Kristian og min tur er det her HIMMELSK! Man har faktisk rum til at opleve tingen :) Dagens tur gÃ¥r ud til Longj rismarkerne et par timer nordpÃ¥. Der er som altid lidt diset, men det er rigtig flot og fascinerende at se hvordan de udnytter deres skrÃ¥ninger. Da vi kommer tilbage gÃ¥r vi en tur ned igennem Guilin by og finder noget at spise. Folk har lidt pÃ¥ skift ondt i maven, og det er fars tur i aften. De andre gÃ¥r hjem, og Henrik og jeg hygger os med at shoppe ubrugelige souvenirs, bl.a. en happy Buddha - til JÃ¸rgen ;)NÃ¦ste dag den 23. sejler vi ned til Yangshuo ad Li floden med nogle fantastiske kalkbjerge ned af den 40 km strÃ¦kning. Igen er der lidt diset, og udsigten kunne vÃ¦re bedre, men i betragtning af den folkemÃ¦ngde Rachelle har forklaret at der var da de var der i efterÃ¥ret, er jeg taknemmelig for det syn vi fik :) Vi ankommer til den dejlige ferieby Yangshuo der er omkranset af bjerge og flot natur. Vi gÃ¥r en tur rundt i byen og finder et sted at fÃ¥ lidt at spise om aftenen inden vi smutter tilbage til hotellet og fÃ¥r skrevet lidt hjem, tjekket email osv. Den 24. tager vi pÃ¥ cykeltur ud i oplandet og ser nogle helt smÃ¥ landsbyer - bl.a. den originale Yangshuo landsby, der senere blev rykket du til floden. Det er en dejlig tur, og rart at rÃ¸re sig lidt pÃ¥ cykel/selv bestemme tempoet lidt. Vi bÃ¸rn vender Ã¸jne, men smutter nu alligevel med ud, da mor og far laver en lang markvandring ind til nogle kinesere der glÃ¦deligt (pÃ¥ kinesisk) fortÃ¦ller om og viser deres afgrÃ¸der :b Vi fÃ¥r vores sidste mÃ¥ltid her, og tager hans bus op til Guilin igen, hvor vi pÃ¥ vejen ser de her fantasiske og store grotter med drypsten og flot lys/lyd show. Kineserne i omrÃ¥det, har gemt sig herinde under diverse krige, men nogle er blevet gasset af netop samme grund. Lee er en fantastisk guide, der fortÃ¦ller en masse om livet i omrÃ¥det, hvad der rÃ¸rer dig (regeringen har endlagt et par hundred fabrikker for at gÃ¸re det til et ferieparadis, hans liv og drÃ¸mme (skal giftes, ikke vÃ¦rdsat at vÃ¦re i turistbranchen, vil gerne udenlands) og gÃ¸r vores tur og forstÃ¥else for omrÃ¥det meget mere dybdegÃ¥ende :) Til aften flyver vi mod Beijing, hvor vi igen ankommer lige ved midnatstid. Vi bliver snydt for en dyr taxa tur, men er trÃ¦tte og ligeglade pÃ¥ det her tidspunkt. 25. januar: Vores nye guide, Lee 2, er knap sÃ¥ god, men han fÃ¥r os da rundt og fortÃ¦ller ogsÃ¥ nogle gode facts - heller ikke nemt at hamle op med ham der er udenfor sÃ¦son og har alt tid/overskud i verden til at fortÃ¦lle om hvad der rÃ¸rer sig). Vi ser den forbudte by, KÃMPE, har kun set en liiiiille bitte del fÃ¸rste gang vi var her da vi kun gik igennem kernen. Her var vi ude og se sideflÃ¸jene ogsÃ¥, som jo er en hel verden for sig selv, wow et byggeri! Familien Hagen er sultne, og vi kender vores pakker, sÃ¥ vi fÃ¥r skubbet den spisning vi bÃ¸r have ind her efter, lidt udenfor Lees egen plan :b Han viser os fredspladsen, og vi er ved at fryse mÃ¥sen af det meste af dagen. Solen er ved at gÃ¥ ned, men vi laver en hurtig beslutning om at vil op og se udsigten fra kulhÃ¸jen (jordhÃ¸j fra udgravningen af den forbudte by). Det er igen lige i sidste Ã¸jeblik, sÃ¥ vi gÃ¥r med lange skridt udenpÃ¥ siden af den forbudte by - jesus den er lang! Vi fÃ¥r til gengÃ¦ld lige (smog)solnedgang over den forbudte by, som er et fantastisk syn!!For at fÃ¥ noget at spise prÃ¸ver vi at gÃ¥ nordpÃ¥ mod trommetÃ¥rnet, men ender op ved et hip sÃ¸omrÃ¥de, som nu er frosset og en kÃ¦mpe skÃ¸jtebane med spisesteder og diskoteker pÃ¥ den anden side af sÃ¸en. De nÃ¦ste par maveonder melder sig, og vi vil egentlig gerne bare hjem efter en lang dag. I Beijing er alle kinesere dog ikke sÃ¥ venligt stillede overfor turister (eller ogsÃ¥ kender vi ikke reglerne?!), og der er ingen taxaer der vil tage os op, sÃ¥ vi ender med, med mit kinesisk, at finde en metro station - mega langt vÃ¦k, for sÃ¥ endeligt at komme hjem. Er nogle trÃ¦tte kroppe efterhÃ¥nden :bDen 26. januar: Juhuuu, min fÃ¸dselsdag :D Hvor heldig er jeg lige, at hele min familie er her til at fejre min fÃ¸dselsdag - I KINA?!?!? :D Havde planer om at ville se muren i dag, men da JÃ¸rgen er slemt ramt, tager vi i stedet en tur pÃ¥ by planlÃ¦gningsmuseet. Bortset fra faktumet at det ikke lignede at det var ordentligt Ã¥bent og alt stod pÃ¥ kinesisk, var deres miniature modeller rigtig spÃ¦ndende :) Om eftermiddagen tager vi hen og ser Temple of Heaven, hvor de bedte for deres afgrÃ¸der. Virkelig flot, men selv familien har set nok templer nu, sÃ¥ man behÃ¸ver ikke at blive der alt for lÃ¦nge mere :POm aftenen har mor arrangeret Peking and og diverse smÃ¥ shows af forskellig kinesisk kultur henne ved skÃ¸jte sÃ¸en. Super spÃ¦ndende, og nÃ¸j hvor var vi glade for at det ikke var kinesisk opera vi var taget ind for at se, som vi ellers havde overvejet - en smerte i ens Ã¸re for bare de par minutter. Men meget underholdende maske-skiftende show. Vi har en dejlig aften, som sluttes af med det eneste sted man kan fÃ¥ en is i omrÃ¥det - McD's McFlurry til hele familien, og jeg har haft en fantastisk fÃ¸dselsdag! :) <3Det bliver sÃ¥ den 27. vi tager turen ud  til muren ved Badaling. FÃ¸rst bliver vi overlagt snydt af hende vi har bestilt henne ved den himmelske freds plads, der pludselig vil have flere hundrede kroner mere. Ãkonomisk gjorde vi ingen fordel i det, men vi aflyser hende og tager hotellets mulighed, mest pga. hendes attitude og mÃ¥de at prÃ¸ve at forklare os, at det var helt okay at prÃ¸ve at snyde os. Denne bus gÃ¥r fÃ¸rst senere, og vi nÃ¥r lige hen og se Ã¦gget indvendigt (kombi af teater, musik og en 3. sal under et og samme tag). Fantastisk arkitektur! Mette har overtaget lidt af ferie-sygdommen, og er ikke helt pÃ¥ toppen, men kommer alligevel helt med op pÃ¥ toppen :) Igen er vi heldige med sÃ¦sonen, for Badaling er normalt PAKKET med mennesker! Der er smÃ¥ tÃ¥get, men ellers en dejlig men kold dag som alle dage i Beijing var! Det meste af dagen gÃ¥r med turen.Den 28. vender vi snuden mod Nanjing/HJEM. Jeg har en dejlig fÃ¸lelse, nu er det 'bare hjem' vi skal :) Vi aftaler, at fra nu af skal vi ogsÃ¥ liiiiiige kunne trÃ¦kke vejret. Alle er trÃ¦tte og mÃ¦tte med oplevelser, og jeg har en masse ting jeg skal pakke og lige nÃ¥ inden jeg tager hjem. Da vi ankommer, smider vi tingene pÃ¥ NUAA hotellet, og gÃ¥r straks om til backalley for at fÃ¥ nogle af de hjemmelavede nudler - MHM siger jeg bare, det er ikke rejsemad for mig mere :D NU er mors og fars penge ankommet - dem det var meningen vi skulle bruge under turen, haha, sÃ¥ der er masser at tage af ;P Viser skolens omrÃ¥de, tager dem med hen til det lokale marked om eftermiddagen og ellers fÃ¥r folk bare lov at slappe lidt af :)Den 29. bliver en praktisk dag for mig, hvor de andre tager hen til Xuanwumen og sejler rundt pÃ¥ sÃ¸erne. Mor og far tager ogsÃ¥ i den lokale lille park/den gamle forbudte by park ved Mingugong, og ser alle de Ã¦ldre danse med svÃ¦rd og tai chi - de var meget begejstrede, og  er virkelig glad for at de fik den oplevelse med ogsÃ¥. Kina Ã©r bare sÃ¥ meget mere en rÃ¥d, spyt, smog og et ufrostÃ¥eligt sprog - parkerne og folkene i parkerne er bare essensen af hele deres kultur :)NÃ¦ste dag, den 30. tager vi op og ser purple mountain, Ming Xiaoling mausoleum og Ming gravene med dyrene. Der er desvÃ¦rre lidt diset, men har en hyggelig tur derop alligevel. Det er noget spÃ¦ndende historie der er i Nanjing, har bare ikke sat sig ordentlig ind i det. Det bliver aften inden vi kommer ned, og tager metroen videre ind til Xinjiekou og spiser pÃ¥ den brasilianske ('KÃDBUFFET'!), det trÃ¦nger man til efter et par uger i Kina uden ordentlig kÃ¸d :b DA vi alligevel er der, ser de Fashion Lady, og resten af centrum omrÃ¥det der, som jeg jo ikke syntes er ret prangende - men de syntes alligevel at det var ret hÃ¸je bygninger :b Efter en eftermiddag/aften tur ud i Fusi Miao, hvor vi render pÃ¥ bÃ¥de en kÃ¦mpe porcelÃ¦n butik, diverse smÃ¥ boder og fÃ¥r en sejltur rundt i bÃ¥dene tager ind og spiser meget kinesisk pÃ¥ Pizza Hut ;) Inden det har vi mÃ¸dtes med Emre og Arzu som er med os rundt og kigge i butikker. Vi kigger udklÃ¦dning til Anna-Marias udklÃ¦dningsfest hjemme og mor og far kÃ¸ber bl.a. en flot bordskÃ¥ner. Mor og far tager hjemaf, men jeg vil ogsÃ¥ gerne lige vise bÃ¸rnene, hvordan man gÃ¥r ud i Kina, sÃ¥ jeg tager dem med til 1912, hvor vi fÃ¸rst smutter ind pÃ¥ Titanium (tror jeg) og senere pÃ¥ Mazzo. Det er sjovt at se deres reaktion pÃ¥ hele den her mega flash kultur i nattelivet, men vilde lysshows, live performances, beklÃ¦dte lounges og bare sjove kinesere i byen :D Ja dÃ©t er livet ;)Den 31. er farvel dag igen. FÃ¥r sagt farvel til Krishika, og landlorden kommer ogsÃ¥ lige forbi - forvirrede/umulig-at-forstÃ¥/men sÃ¸de kvinde :D Jeg fÃ¥r smidt de sidste ting i kufferten, og sÃ¥ drager vi afsted. Emre fÃ¸lger os op til vejen :) Vi ankommer i Shanghai, og tager ud og henter drengenes FLOTTE SUITS, suit up for vildt :D Vi spiser tÃ¦t pÃ¥ deres hotel, mit sidste mÃ¥ltid, for jeg flyver om aftenen. Lidt en mÃ¦rkelig fÃ¸lelse, men nu jeg har rejst med familien og vist dem det ogsÃ¥, og generelt rejst sÃ¥ meget fÃ¸ler jeg at jeg har oplevet det til fulde. Har fÃ¥et nogle dejlige venner her, og en opvlevelse stÃ¸rre en jeg havde forestillet mig da jeg tog afsted hjemmefra!!! Lidt vemodigt da jeg tager mod lufthavnen, og sÃ¦tter mig alene i flyet, men kan godt mÃ¦rke at det er sundt lige at have den her overgang til hjem alene ogsÃ¥. Jeg fÃ¥r tÃ¦nkt rigtig mange ting igennem i den her overgangsfase, og nÃ¥r at vÃ¦nne mig til tanken om at komme hjem. Den sidste halvanden mÃ¥ned har jo vÃ¦ret hÃ¦sblÃ¦sende med Shanghai med Rasmus, jul, eksaminer, nytÃ¥r, farveller, Gerogias hjem, farveller, 2 ugers intens Kina, og sÃ¥ nu endelig i det fly man har vidst sÃ¥ lÃ¦nge skulle lette pÃ¥ et tidspunkt. Er en surealistisk fÃ¸lelse at tÃ¦nke pÃ¥ alle de ting man har vÃ¦ret udsat for, oplevet og kommet igennem for sÃ¥ nu bare at vende tilbage hjem igen til den normale hverdag igen. Det er ogsÃ¥ en flytur der bliver brugt meget pÃ¥ at gÃ¸re sig tanker om hvordan jeg skal agere nÃ¥r jeg kommer hjem. Jeg er bevidst om at jeg er den der har vÃ¦ret vÃ¦k og vÃ¦ret dÃ¥rlig til at holde kontakt, og skal gÃ¸re arbejdet for at komme ind pÃ¥ folk igen. Dette er ogsÃ¥ en tid jeg glÃ¦der mig meget til, og da jeg letter fra min mellemlanding i Dubai, tÃ¦nker jeg ikke sÃ¥ meget pÃ¥ Kina savnet mere, men nu pÃ¥ den glÃ¦delige tid med genforeninger :) 1.-4. februar: Den nÃ¦ste uge gÃ¥r med at komme hjem, ses med folk, flytte ind i mit nuvÃ¦rende kÃ¦re hjem Guldsmedgade 21B og i mellemtiden bo ved Kristian. Alt er stadig lige sÃ¥ hektisk, og er nok ikke ret god til at lÃ¦gge mig forrige mÃ¥neds 'hu hej skal nÃ¥ noget og nogen' attitude fra mig, men nÃ¥r jo sÃ¥ ogsÃ¥ en masse ;) Ses med Pernille, Karoline og Kalle (til kalles rengÃ¸ring af karos bÃ¸rnehave) og alt virker bare som om man ikke har vÃ¦ret vÃ¦k , mhm :) Gensynet med bedsterne var fantastisk, og jeg har vÃ¦rdsat dem og deres samvÃ¦r det sidste halve Ã¥r (dags dato 10.7.13) mere end nogensinde fÃ¸r!! Familie er generelt blevet en vigtig faktor for mig pÃ¥ mange mÃ¥der, mÃ¥ske en blanding af at e hvor essentiel den er i andre kulturer (kinesisk sÃ¥vel som mellemÃ¸stlig og afrikansk), men ogsÃ¥ fordi jeg har vÃ¦ret sÃ¥ langt ude nogen gange, hvor man bare vidste at de stod lige i ryggen og bakkede en op :) mors hoptimist med det danske flag var bare lige i Ã¸jet da hun sendte den med Kristian over - jeg ved hun har bekymret sig, og det var hendes mÃ¥de at give en hÃ¥nd pÃ¥ skulderen, som bare varmede hele vejen igennem kroppen :) Hehe ogsÃ¥ farmors marzipan brÃ¸d varmede, da jeg vidst at mor og far nok spiste dem hjemme under hÃ¸sten som de plejede ogsÃ¥. Alle disse traditioner, som man ikke har lagt noget i, lÃ¦gger man pludselig mÃ¦rke til nÃ¥r de ikke er der og der sÃ¥ kommer en kÃ¦rlig lille tanke :) Alle vennerne i 'gruppen' ser jeg heldigvis i weekenden den 9. februar, da lone holder gradutation party i Odense. Dejligt at se dem ogsÃ¥, og igen, nÃ¥r man sÃ¥ lige er ovre de uundgÃ¥elige 'hvordan var det sÃ¥', sÃ¥ er alt jo som det plejer igen - pÃ¥ en dejlig beroligende mÃ¥de. Nu er man hjemme igen, sÃ¥ mÃ¥ der gerne vÃ¦re lidt ro pÃ¥ pÃ¥ vennefronten igen :)I lÃ¸bet af det nÃ¦ste halve Ã¥r sker der sÃ¥ utrolig meget ogsÃ¥, men mest i min livsholdning. Jeg gÃ¸r kun til jeg syntes om og som er godt for mig selv (nytÃ¥rsforsÃ¦t). Jeg bliver nÃ¦stformand og meget aktiv i IngeniÃ¸rer Uden GrÃ¦nser, skal finde praktik (fÃ¥r Danfoss igennem Carsten Dahlgaard efter megen sÃ¸gen/tidskrÃ¦vende men lÃ¦rerigt), skal skrive delopgave i flere fag (bl.a. for Carsten i International Business Marketing), og skriver semesteropgave for firmaet TAGARNO. SkolemÃ¦ssigt kommer jeg meget tÃ¦ttere pÃ¥ hvad jeg vil i fremtiden, og pga. alt den sÃ¸gen i de forskellige fagomrÃ¥der og firmaer fÃ¥r jeg et meget stÃ¸rre overblik over hvad vi har af muligheder fremover. Ligeledes fÃ¥r jeg nu nÃ¦sten kun fag jeg gerne vil have, sÃ¥ ender med 2x10 tal og 3x12 tal for semesteret - lidt stolt, samtidig med at pendle fra Ãrhus til Horsens, vÃ¦re aktiv i IUG og vÃ¦re begyndt i Adventure Ãrhus klubben, som ps. ogsÃ¥ er et skridt i den vej jeg vil. Jeg har fundet en flok folk der elsker at vÃ¦re ude og dyrke det, som er en fantastisk erstatning/kick starter til min lyst til spejdertiden :D DesvÃ¦rre holdte Kristian og jeg ikke dog, men tiden udenlands endte med at vÃ¦re for hÃ¥rd ved os.Men alt i alt er jeg i et fantastisk sted i mit liv lige nu, har aldrig vÃ¦ret sÃ¥ bevidst om hvad jeg ville/om at det jeg gÃ¸r er det jeg vil, klare mig sÃ¥ godt og samtidig vÃ¦ret sÃ¥ glad pÃ¥ samme tid :D + om 4 dage tager jeg en mÃ¥ned til Afrika med Esther og Lone, det bliver heller ikke vÃ¦rst :D Et glad og taknemmelig peace out fra hende der voksede og blev klogere af de udfordringer hun blev bragt og overvandt :)"
"Our trip is nearly over it is so sad we only have two more places to stay Hong Kong and Penang! We will be very happy to see everybody. We had a very nice time in Yangshuo we went on bike rides and we did a cooking class. We learnt how to make dumplings, Kung Pao chicken, pan fried eggplant and Beer fish. We went to a place called the water cave it was very cool there was a piece of limestone that was shaped like a throne and I got to sit in it and have my photo ..."
Today we had a free day... Geckos love their free time! It was quite welcome as I was feeling pretty vile so had a long lie.  After a nice long sleep we ventured out of bed and had a shower etc before we had a knock on the door from Blair and Glen... They were bored and wanted to play cards or something.  We finished packing and decided to head out for a wee jaunt before we were due to meet the others at 3pm.We  headed down the Main Street and looked at the shops... Blair wanted to buy some souvenirs and we wanted a magnet.  After a while we found a nice large pond with the mountains behind... We took some pics and then headed to Macy's Ds for lunch as Steven was pretty hungry by now and this Maccers had the best view ever.  We had a bite and warmed up a little then headed back out and Blair bought some earrings and we bought a magnet.  I was feeling pretty rubbish and my chest hurt so when the suggestion of a warm cup of tea was made I happily jumped at the chance.  We found a quant little place with wooden furniture and big soft cushions and headed in.  We were all trying to use up the last of our Chinese money so ordered a pot of tea and sat in the relative warmth of the cafe.  We sat for ages chatting and using the free wifi and they must have taken the hint that we were skint as they kept topping our pot up for free... We had ordered a lemongrass tea and it came in a beautiful glass teapot that was kept warm on tea lights.After we had sat and thawed out for an hour or so we headed back to meet the others in the lobby of the hotel.  We then set off for the drive back to Guilin for the night train towards Hong Kong.  The journey was uneventful and felt long... Mainly due to me trying to repress my coughing and sniffily nose.  We arrived at the train station and had an hour wait for the train so settled down and played crazy eights... We were getting into the swing of it and watching random Chinese music videos when the time came to board the train.  We were in the same compartment as Blair and Glen and the other guys were spread out elsewhere.  We waited for ages to finally be allowed through the gate and then waited ages to board the train as half the doors were not open... Was the most chaotic train boarding yet.Once we finally boarded the train we sat down and chilled out before the train departed then we munched our noodles and drank a coffee from our enamel cups.  We then settled down into bed for a good sleep... We were due in Guangzhou at about seven am.
"We got a to Guilin at 5pm. As there are 2 train stations we weren't sure which one we were going to. As it turned out we were in the closest one to the hostel so we walked for 15mins and found it straight away. We checked in and went to the bar.After a few beers the English guy we met in Beijing walked in. He was stopping in the same hostel as us. We proceeded to play drinking games with doubles in pool, the losers drinks a shot of a Chinese spirit call Baiju (60% proof and very horrible). James' lack of skill in pool meant we lost majorly and had quite a few shots. Towards the end of the night someone knocked a shot over, it was moped up in 5mins. During that time it had stripped the varnish away on the bar. We decided that Baiju couldn't be good for us and limited ourselves. We agreed to stop after the bottle was drunk. James felt unwell and retired to bed. I stayed up for more pool. I should have followed James lead as I didn't feel very well when I finally went to bed. The next day we spent nursing our hangovers and watched a few films. In the evening a big group of people from the hostel went for food, mostly Europeans, there was a few Asian people out as well. We went to a street food BBQ place where they had seats for small children. We let the Chinese speaking people in the group order. They mostly did a good job ordering chicken, oysters, octopus tentacles and pigs brain soup that were surprisingly nice. With a few beers each the bill came to Â£2 per person.We decided to find a bar and found one after an hour of looking. We played a nice drinking game with more Baiju. Thankfully neither James or I lost. We found a club afterwards where they brought out chickens feet as nibbles. They were black and tasted horrible.They next day was raining so we didn't go too far from the hostel. We booked our tickets to Hong Kong. We decided to get a sleeper bus for a change. At night we had a few beers but took it easy. James entered an illegal poker tournament and came second while I watched a few films. The last full day we went to Yangshuo, it's a really scenic town. We hired a moped out for the day and went round the mountains. They asked for Â£100 deposit, we only had Â£20 on us. Using our excellent negotiating skills we settled on Â£20 deposit. They didn't ask for a driving licence and didn't give us any helmets (there's millions of mopeds in China and no one wears a helmet). After a day riding around we went for pizza and headed back to Guilin. Once back at our hostel we hid in the room so no one could tempt us to drink. We walked around the city on the before we left for Hong Kong. We had some food at the hostel and decided to get a bottle of Baiju for when we met Rob (a friend from home) in Hong Kong. The trouble was when we got back to the hostel we met more people and nearly drank the bottle. We found the bus station with help from a few locals. The beds on the bus were no way near big enough for me but perfect for James. James reminded me again we're with his kind of people now. We both remember the bus breaking down in the middle of the night but slept through most of it. When we woke up we were somewhere near Hong Kong but no idea where. After a hour of looking we found the right bus to take us over the border. Once in Hong Kong we found our hostel pretty easily."
"Day 35 The train in to Guilin was late and didn't arrive until 1pm. Once off the train we realised we wern't at the train station we had hoped for. The train station we were at was the north train station and the directions we had were from the central station. We walked over to the tourist information box to see if any of the buses here went to the central station. The box was empty so we stood and waited, two women eventually turned up and one sat at the window we were at, she didn't look at us, picked up a magazine and held it up to her face. Shocked we started saying 'Nihao' (hello) but she just laughed, spoke to her friend in Chinese and said 'no, no'. We wern't going to move, we understand she only spoke limited English but she hadn't even attemped to speak to us. We showed her the map we had pointing at the central bus station and said 'daba' (bus) a few times untill she eventually gave up her rudeness and wrote the number 100 on a peice of paper. We jumped on the number 100 bus and got off at what looked like a train station and made our way to the hostel from there. We dropped our bags and walked back to the train station to book our next set of tickets to Hangzhou. Once in the queue we realised we didn't have enough money so set off to find an ATM. Three ATMs later we managed to get some money and headed back to the train station. Once in the queue again we noticed we didn't have our passports (you can't by tickets without them) Our tiredness from the sleepless night train was starting to show! After a 30 min round trip to the hostel it was third time lucky. With our tickets finally bought  we jumped on a bus to the central square. The weather was beautiful, hot and the sun shining, we walked round the square which was a bit of a let down then wandered round the streets nearby. It felt very touristy with many streets full of lovely looking restaurants, cafes and bakerys, all with English menus. We continued to walk towards Seven Stars park, stopping at the river where we sat on the side watching people swim, fish and wash their clothes. It was about 4pm and the sun was starting to sink, the mountains along the lake were so beautiful and we realised why the place was so popular. After sitting a while we walked along to the park but once there we saw the entrance fee was Â£8 each which wasn't worth it as the sun wasn't far from setting. We managed to find a lovely spot next to the river that over looked the citys famous Sun and Moon pagodas so we sat and watched the sun set. There was a night market starting in town so we walked back along the bridge for a look around, feeling hungry we stopped on the way for a claypot. The pots were filled with rice, egg and some kind of meat they seemed to be pulling out of a black binliner. The meat was like nothing we had tried before, we joked it may have been dog meat but God only knows. Feeling full and freaked out we looked round the night market before heading back to hostel. We sat with a Chinese lad from our room and had a drink before bed. Day 36 We woke up early and checked out, We had booked a tour with the hostel and the bus was coming for us at 9:30am. There was a big supermarket opposite the hostel so we stocked up on some food for the day and got some breakfast before the pick up. After picking up a few people we were on our way to the Li river for our bamboo raft trip. On the bus the tour guide explained the raft wasn't real bamboo but actually plastic and would be driven by a motor but if we wanted to have a real bamboo raft, a trip to see the water buffalo and feed them and get to see fishermen fishing with cormorant birds we could pay an extra Â£13 each and do the afternoon tour. We showed interest but decided to leave it as we had already paid quite a bit for the original tour. On the raft the river was beautiful with mountains towering over us, all different shapes and formations. We passed a few of the famous formations which didn't look like anything they were supposed to be such as a brush and nine horses hill. The tour guide came on our raft and because we had shown interest before she tried to get us to sign up the the second tour. We told her it was too expensive and she finally came back to us with a price of Â£10 each which we felt was a bit better so we agreed. The bus took us to our next destination and after a walk through a small village and a few interesting facts from the tour guide, we were led to the the real bamboo rafts. They were so cute with two chairs, a big sun umberella and a man guiding the boat through the river with just a stick of Bamboo. The river we were on now was the Yulong river and with no pollution from motor boats it was beautifully clear. We saw a fisherman instantly and he put on a show for us with his cormorant birds. They were so fast and so clever working with the fisherman to catch the fish. We glided down the river and it was so peaceful Lloyd even managed a little doze. We got off at an island to feed the water buffalo which was fun, then we were taken to a part of the river that has a mini (30cm) drop which we went down on the raft and was a little bit more scary than we anticipated. After a really lovely relaxing day we were dropped off in Yangshou. We dropped our bags off at the hostel and headed straight back out. The main street was packed you could hardly move, the streets were full of restaurants and fancy bars, we hadn't seen anything like it anywhere else in China. We opted for a modest looking bar with an English menu and ordered a lovely beef in Oyster Sauce, rice, pork noodles, a beer and my first glass of wine of the trip (Great Wall white wine). After polishing it all off and enjoying a game of connect 4 (which Lloyd won) we walked back to the hostel. Day 37 We hadn't really decided what we wanted to do today so we had a lie-in and a lazy morning. There was a Canadian lad in our room called Corey who we had breakfast with, the three of us decided to hire bikes and cycle to a nearby village. We paid a little extra for mountain bikes as we thought the road would be bumpy and we were on our way. After 10 minutes Lloyd tried to change gear and the chain came off and snapped some kind of plastic shield off - great start. He fixed the chain back on and we were back on track, the road was so dusty we could hardly breath, there were tunnels cutting through mountains we had to cycle through and a lot of traffic on the road so it wasn't enjoyable. My seat was broken and the more bumps I went over the more it fell back making it impossible to ride as I could hardly reach the handlebars and the I felt like I was falling off. To make matters worse even though my bike was smaller it was much heavier than Lloyd and Corey's so I couldn't keep, especially up the hills. Lloyd saw I was struggling and came to my rescue and swapped bikes with me. We made it to a village called Fuli and found it to be a bit disappointing at first with just falling down buildings and dusty roads. We decided to cycle in to the village to see what we could find. We passed a market so stopped to have a look around, we were hungry so stopped for hotpot. The lady spoke no English but presented us with tray of all types of meat from brain and liver to what looked like pork and beef, we pointed at the safer looking meat and she gave us loads of what we asked for and even more of what we didn't and a massive plate of veg too. We got stuck in piling meat and veg in to the bubbling pot and adding it to our rice once it was cooked - delicious!!  We got back on our bikes and it wasn't long until we found some lovely little streets to cycle down full of art galleries, people painting and handmade fans of all sizes, wish we had loads of money to buy all the beautiful things! We saw a rice wine factory which consisted of a woman making the wine on her own, she gave us a taste and it was lovely so sweet and warm (probably still fermenting)! We cycled towards the river, crossed a small bridge which lead us on to a field full of water buffalo then headed through a few farmers fields to the other side of the river away from the village and the boats. We tied up our bikes and walked along the river side to a more peaceful spot. The mountains were so beautiful and river so clear, we sat there for half an hour before heading back. Lloyd got so sick of the bike we stopped at a mechanics and they tightened up the screws on the bike seat and I got back on my own bike. Once back we handed over our bikes and headed down to the river, Lloyd and Corey got in for a swim and I dipped my feet in, it was so clear and full of tiny fish. Me and Lloyd headed in to the town centre for food deciding on a gorgeous plate of beer duck, curried potatoes and some rice. Lloyd had a doughnut the night before that we watched being fried, dipped in chocolate and nuts and served pipping hot, as I hate doughnuts I didn't bother but once I tasted it I fell in love, it was delicious, so we went to get one after the meal and went back to the hostel as it was getting late. Day 38 We packed our bags and said goodbye to Corey who left early. There was an English breakfast on the menu that was really cheap so we caved and thought it would set us up for the day. After our eggs, bacon, toast and coffee we headed for the 2 hour bus back to Guillin. We bought some noodles and goodies from the super market, grabbed some street food (a pancake with egg and some kind of pickled veg filling and a boiled egg each) then we boarded out 18 hour train to Hangzhou."
"We caught another overnight train to guilin and arrived late at night, we caught a taxi to the hotel, which we got cheaper cos it didnt have any windows! it also didnt have many lights!guilin was a really beautiful area, with limestone peaks dotted around, and plenty of peaks to climb. we went to the sun and moon pagodas, which are in the photos, and visited the national parks, but it rained for a lot of the time that we were in guilin, and there wasnt that much to do that wasnt outside!"
"In guilin which is kind of a river resort to the Chinese lot more scenic a lot better air no pollution still hot and the locals love to swim (personally I wouldn't they still spit and s*** in it ) anyway hired a bamboo raft to take me four hours down the river to the next town which is kind of the travellers place of china.a couple of things that freak me out in china couples were identical clothes which is weird,and anyone who knows me knows when it comes to food I'm not against the unusual , however the restaurants in china display there produce alive on the street outside which is fine , different fish swimming in bowls and tanks ,chickens in cages ready to be slaughtered and cooked whenever ordered and I even can cope with the turtles in bowls floating around ready to be soup ,but the sight of the bamboo rats (which look like furry beavers) freaking out and furiously gnawing at the metal bars in an effort to escape freaked me out.don't get me wrong I would eat it if thats what was offered,but watching it dragged kicking and screaming to its death for me just to find out how it would taste, I can't do it.on a separate note its very awkward being around couples who have had a row makes conversation very awkward and believe me happens a lot.ha"
"OK, so I'm updating this as I'm trying to upload some photos. I tried last night too but the connection is too slow so it takes a few hours and then kicks you out at the last bit. I'm in another cafe today though but it still says 89 minutes to upload 8 photos So there will not be many as I'm not spending the last week of my trip on the Internet!We wake up in Guilin and I go downstairs to have a coffee. I'm feeling the need for a sugar fix so I ask for milk AND sugar in my coffee. The guy says I can have only milk  sugar I assume it is lost in translation but none the less cannot be bothered explaining so just opt for milk.We head out for a look around and to try and book train tickets for Guilin to Chengdu. But once again no joy. This is not apparent straight away though and it takes us 3 trips to the train station before accepting this as an answer (they just kept telling us to come back in a few hours). We are feeling pretty crap now at the thought of having to pay out for yet another flight. We try and book our train from Chengdu to Beijing but no joy there either. We give up. We head back to the hostel and decide to get out of Guilin and head to Yangshao. We pick up some street food a long the way. I get this rice wrapped in lotus leaf ( I have had in the UK and enjoy it). This one is funny, it has kidney beans or something in it. Can you guess where is goes after one mouthful........yes the bin (you're getting good at this game).We look around for a place for lunch before we leave. We find somewhere and sit down. Sally is looking a bit uncomfortable and I ask her what's wrong she says nothing. I assume like me she is finding the bright yellow table cloths a bit sickly. I can hear a chicken making a right noise and look round thinking he must be in the garden. I glance to my right side and see about 10 chickens in this cage all waiting to be killed. We leave!We find somewhere else and order crispy beef. On this menu we have the usual choice of pig stomach, dog, frog and boiled bacteria! The beef  arrives and it is not crispy beef that I know of. It is not very well cooked and covered in breadcrumbs with mayonnaise lavished all over it. We don't really eat it.Yangshao is 1 and half hours away from Guilin by local bus. We wait at the bus station and get chatting to an American guy (who we had been saying was pretty hot as we thought he was french and could not understand us, he could understand us though ...oops).The bus journey is like a rolercoaster ride, with some very near misses. I spend some of the journey with my hand over my eyes and feeling like I was driving with all the imaginary breaking I was doing!I'm mesmerised though by the number of lemon stalls along the road, just hundreds all the way!We get to Yangshao and it isn't what we were expecting. I was expecting some quaint little village but it is actually like  Kavos for the Chinese. Although it is pretty and the scenery surrounding it is pretty dramatic. We check in and wander around. Alot of the bars are playing really loud music, too loud. This night we have some simple food. Sally has lasagna and I have a burrito.  We find a cafe bar and have a beer. We then head back to the hostel for an early night as tomorrow we want to get out and about."
"Korea irtautui Japanista 1945 jakautuen samana vuonna 38 leveyspiirin kohdalta EtelÃ¤- ja Pohjois-Koreaksi. 1948-1994 DPRK:ta (Democratic People's Republic Korea) johti iÃ¤isen presidentti nimikkeen saanut Kim Il Sung. Kimin kuoltua heinÃ¤kuussa 1994 vallan otti kÃ¤siinsÃ¤ hÃ¤nen poikansa ""johtaja"" Kim Jong Il. HeidÃ¤n mukaansa on nimetty kansalliskukat kimilsungia ja kimjongilia, jotka Suomessa tunnetaan paremmin pegoniana ja orkideana. Asukkaita Pohjois-Koreassa on tÃ¤llÃ¤ hetkellÃ¤ 24 miljoonaa. Maassa ei oikeastaan tunneta nimitystÃ¤ Pohjois-Korea, vaan on olemassa Korea, joka on jakautunut pohjoiseen ja etelÃ¤iseen osaan.VenÃ¤lÃ¤isvalmisteinen Tupolev kesti hyvin noin kahden tunnin matkan PekingistÃ¤ Pyongyangin pienelle lentokentÃ¤lle. Lennolla oli pÃ¤Ã¤osin kiinalaisia ja korealaisia, mutta nÃ¤in myÃ¶s muutaman lÃ¤nsimaalaisen bisnesmiehen. Koneessa huomasin monen pitÃ¤vÃ¤n rinnuksessaan pinssiÃ¤, jossa oli Kim Il Sungin kuva. MyÃ¶hemmin selvisi, ettÃ¤ se on hallituksen myÃ¶ntÃ¤mÃ¤ kunnianosoitus presidentille ja myÃ¶hemmin nÃ¤in samaisen pinssin jok'ikisen korealaisen takissa. Matkatavaroita saatiin odotella kentÃ¤llÃ¤ jonkun aikaa. Vain noin neljÃ¤sosa matkatavaroista oli matkalaukkuja; loput olivat pahvilaatikkoja sisÃ¤ltÃ¤en elektroniikkaa. Joku taisi kantaa jopa taulutelkkaria ulos terminaalista. Jo PekingissÃ¤ vÃ¤hÃ¤n mietitytti mihin sitÃ¤ ollaankaan menossa, sillÃ¤ erÃ¤s noin 60-vuotias korealaismies kaivoi kÃ¤simatkatavaroistaan muovipussin, jossa oli nippu satasen dollareita. HÃ¤n alkoi laskea niitÃ¤ ja valehtelematta nipussa oli rahaa ainakin 10000 dollarin edestÃ¤. MitÃ¤ rahoja lienee ollutâ¦ Lennon aikana tÃ¤ytettiin kolme eri maahantuloon liittyvÃ¤Ã¤ lomaketta, joista viimeisin palautettiin tullille. Kaikki matkatavarat lÃ¤pivalaistiin ja molemmat laukut jouduin avaamaan tullimiehelle. HÃ¤n halusi nÃ¤hdÃ¤ erikseen jopa rinkassa olevat vaatteeni, mutta koska lento oli muutenkin myÃ¶hÃ¤ssÃ¤ ja taakseni alkoi kertyÃ¤ jonoa, tutkiminen jÃ¤i erittÃ¤in lyhyeksi. KÃ¤nnykkÃ¤ laitettiin kirjekuoreen ja sinetÃ¶itiin. Tullilla oli vastassa oppaani, 25-vuotias nainen nimeltÃ¤Ã¤n Kim. Matkalla autolle tapasin myÃ¶s toisen oppaani, noin nelikymppisen miehen, nimeltÃ¤Ã¤n Kim. Kuulemma Kim on erittÃ¤in yleinen nimi Koreassa (presidentti Kim, johtaja Kim, kuka nyt ei haluaisi olla Kim?) Autokuskini ei sentÃ¤Ã¤n ollut Kim vaan hÃ¤nen nimensÃ¤ oli Lee. KentÃ¤ltÃ¤ matka jatkui Haebangsan hotellille, joka sijaitsi Pyongyangin keskustassa. Automatka kesti puolisen tuntia ja tuona aikana nÃ¤in kymmenkunta autoa koko kaupungissa. Kaduilla ei ollut juuri ihmisiÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n. Hotellille pÃ¤Ã¤styÃ¤ni oli vuorossa pÃ¤ivÃ¤llinen. Minulle oli varattu pÃ¶ytÃ¤ numero 7. Kyselin hyviÃ¤, paikallisia ruokia ja valittuani pari annosta ruokalistalta, kuulin ettÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤lliseni onkin jo valmistettu ja eteeni tuotiin keittiÃ¶n valitsemat ruoat. Tarjolla oli muun muassa kaalisalaattia, kanakeittoa (enemmÃ¤nkin lientÃ¤, jossa oli kolme kananpalaa), jonkun sortin rÃ¶stiperunoita ja possusta valmistettu jauhelihapihvi.  Saatuani ruoat oppaat lÃ¤htivÃ¤t syÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤n erikseen heille varattuun huoneeseen. Ilta oli oikeastaan siinÃ¤ ja yÃ¶ tuli nukuttua erinomaisesti, takana kun oli junamatka Shanghaista Pekingiin.Aamulla herÃ¤sin seiskan pintaan Ã¤Ã¤niin, jotka tulivat hotellin pihalta. Kaiuttimista kuului koreaksi naisen Ã¤Ã¤ni ja toisinaan joku orkesteri soitti marssimusiikkia. Aamupalalla valitsin itselleni pÃ¶ydÃ¤n, mutta pian minut siirrettiin samalle paikalle, jolla olin istunut edellisenÃ¤ iltana. Buffetaamiainen ei ollut kovin maittava: tarjolla oli erikoista puuroa, kaalisalaattia, paahtoleipÃ¤Ã¤ (ei maistunut kovin tuoreelta), pavuilla tÃ¤ytettyjÃ¤ sÃ¤mpylÃ¶itÃ¤, keitettyjÃ¤ kananmunia ja teetÃ¤. Olin edellisenÃ¤ iltana kysynyt mahdollisuudesta saada Kiinan viisumia kun sellaista ei ollut, ja aamulla hotellilta lÃ¤hdettyÃ¤mme otimme auton kyytiin miehen kadunkulmasta. Oppaat ja mies keskustelivat hetken aikaa, tÃ¤ytin viisumihakemuksen ja annoin passikuvan mukaan. Mies poistui autosta yhtÃ¤ hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤sti kuin sinne oli tullut nousten toisen auton kyytiin. EdessÃ¤ oli pÃ¤ivÃ¤n kestÃ¤vÃ¤ kaupunkikierros. Alkuun ihmettelin tosin minne oltiin matkalla, sillÃ¤ ajettuamme vartin verran pois kaupungista, vastaan alkoi tulla pelkÃ¤stÃ¤Ã¤n armeijan autoja ja muutaman kerran meidÃ¤n pysÃ¤ytettiin tiesululla. Tiesulut oli varustettu armeijan henkilÃ¶stÃ¶llÃ¤ ja rynnÃ¤kkÃ¶kivÃ¤Ã¤reissÃ¤ oli lippaat ja pistimet kiinni. EnpÃ¤ ihmettelisi jos lippaat oli tÃ¤ytetty ampumatarvikkeilla. VÃ¤hÃ¤n ajan pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ pysÃ¤hdyimme valtavalle parkkipaikalle, jolla ei ollut muita autoja, ja vierailimme Korean perustajan kuningas Tangunin haudalla. Visiitin pÃ¤Ã¤tteeksi tiskin alta kaivettiin matkamuistoja, jos niitÃ¤ olisin halunnut ostaa. Tarjolla oli muun muassa postikortteja, haudan pienoismalleja ja kirjoja 90-luvulta. Haudan paikan oli valinnut itse presidentti ja parempaa paikkaa ei kuulemma olisi voinut lÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤â¦ Parkkipaikalla kÃ¤vimme lÃ¤pi muutamia sÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¶jÃ¤ valokuvaamisesta: kuvia ei ollut lupa ottaa armeijan henkilÃ¶istÃ¤ eikÃ¤ ajoneuvoista. KiellettyÃ¤ oli ottaa kuvia myÃ¶s autolla ajettaessa. Jos halusin ottaa ihmisistÃ¤ kuvia, heiltÃ¤ piti saada lupa ja jokaisen on hymyiltÃ¤vÃ¤ kuvassa. Haudalta ajoimme Korean Filmistudiolle, jonka alueelta saattoi lÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤ mm. korealaisen kaupungin ja kylÃ¤n sekÃ¤ japanilaisen, kiinalaisen ja lÃ¤nsimaalaisen kaupunkimaiseman. Kaikki lavasteet olivat 1930-40-lukujen mallia, mutta nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¶illÃ¤ kuvataan edelleen vuosittain kymmeniÃ¤ elokuvia. Itse presidenttikin taisi ollut ohjannut pari elokuvaa aikanaan. Hotellilla sÃ¶in lounaan, ja tÃ¤llÃ¤ kertaa sain valita ruoan listalta.IltapÃ¤ivÃ¤stÃ¤ oli vuorossa Pyongyangin metro, jolla liikuttiin kahden aseman vÃ¤li. Jokainen metroasema on 100 metrin syvyydessÃ¤ ja reitillÃ¤ niitÃ¤ taitaa olla 16 kappaletta. Muita nÃ¤htÃ¤vyyksiÃ¤ ennen pÃ¤ivÃ¤llistÃ¤: Moran Park (iso puistoalue), Arch of Triumph, Juche Tower ja Monument to Party Foundation. Juche Tower on korkein muurattu torni maailmassa. Tornin lÃ¤heisyydessÃ¤ opiskelijat harjoittelivat marssimista huhtikuussa jÃ¤rjestettÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ paraatia varten, joka tulee muuten olemaan yksi suurimmista Korean historiassa. Jos en ihan vÃ¤Ã¤rin muista, niin kyseessÃ¤ on presidentin syntymÃ¤pÃ¤ivÃ¤paraati tai jotakin sinne pÃ¤in. Rivit olivat varmasti sÃ¤rmiÃ¤ ja kaikki marssivat tahdissa! Jossain vaiheessa pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ vanhempi opas sanoi, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤net kutsuttiin takaisin toimistolle ja saan pian uuden oppaan. Oma veikkaukseni on, ettÃ¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤ ""opas"" lÃ¤hetettiin alun perin tutkimaan millainen henkilÃ¶ olen ja kun selvisi, etten ollut amerikkalainen vakooja, hÃ¤n poistui paikalta. Kaiken puhumisen tÃ¤hÃ¤n saakka oli meinaan hoitanut naispuolinen oppaani ja toinen ""opas"" kulki joko 50 metriÃ¤ meidÃ¤n edessÃ¤ tai takana seuraten sivusta mitÃ¤ teemme. Olin miettinyt koko pÃ¤ivÃ¤n millaisia kysymyksiÃ¤ viitsin kysyÃ¤ ja kÃ¤velyllÃ¤ puistossa pÃ¤Ã¤tin avata suuni. Kyselin oppaan mielipidettÃ¤ Koreasta ja kuulemma Korea on ainoa oikea paikka elÃ¤Ã¤. Juteltiin myÃ¶s Kim Jong Ilin pojista, joiden olemassaolosta opas ei tiennyt. Lopuksi kysyin, kuka ottaa vallan johtajan kuoltua. Opas tuohtui ja vastasi, ettÃ¤ johtaja on erinomaisessa terveydentilassa eikÃ¤ asiasta ole tarvetta keskustella. SiitÃ¤ ei siis keskusteltu enempÃ¤Ã¤. Illalla pelasin uuden oppaani kanssa muutaman biljardipelin ja maistoin paria korealaista olutta. Ennen nukkumaanmenoa opas kysyi mitÃ¤ mieltÃ¤ olin aamupalasta. Sanoin vÃ¤hÃ¤n kierrellen, ettei se ollut kovin hyvÃ¤ ja hÃ¤n kysyi mitÃ¤ haluaisin. Seuraavana aamuna pÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤n tuotiin kaikki mitÃ¤ olin edellisenÃ¤ iltana sanonut haluavaniâ¦Torstain kohteet: Kim Il Sungin mausoleumi (pyhÃ¤Ã¤kin pyhempi paikka), Korea War Museum, Sotalaiva Pueblo, Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery ja Ryongpuk Middle School. Aamusta vierailtiin mausoleumilla, jossa v. 1994 kuolleen presidentin ruumis oli esillÃ¤. Pukukoodi oli erittÃ¤in tiukka, joskin ulkomaalaisena sain vÃ¤hÃ¤n lÃ¶ysyyttÃ¤, sillÃ¤ pukua mulla ei ollut mukana. Itse korealaiset pukeutuvat parhaisiin vaatteisiin mitÃ¤ heiltÃ¤ lÃ¶ytyy. Turvatarkastus oli jopa tarkempi kuin lentokentÃ¤lle mennessÃ¤ ja matkalla mausoleumille meidÃ¤n kengÃ¤t pestiin ja juuri ennen ruumista kuljimme tuulitunnelin lÃ¤pi. Ennen ruumiin nÃ¤kemistÃ¤ sain kuulla englanninkielisen pÃ¤tkÃ¤n presidentin kuolemasta ja siitÃ¤ miten kova isku se oli kansalle. ÃÃ¤ni nauhalla sanoi: ""Niin lapset kuin aikuisetkin itkivÃ¤t kuullessaan presidentin poismenosta."" Ruumis makasi lasiarkussa ja jouduimme kunnioittamaan presidenttiÃ¤ kumartamalla kolmelta eri sivulta kohti ruumista. Kuvien perusteella se ainakin nÃ¤ytti ihan Kim Il Sungilta. Seuraavassa huoneessa oli esillÃ¤ kaikki presidentin saamat mitalit ja kunnianosoitukset. Pohjois-Korean hallitus oli myÃ¶ntÃ¤nyt hÃ¤nelle neljÃ¤ kertaa sankari-mitalin, jotkut maat olivat antaneet hÃ¤nelle kunniakansalaisuuden ja muutama yliopisto todistuksen suoritetuista tutkinnoista. ViimeisessÃ¤ huoneessa oli esillÃ¤ presidentin kÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤ junavaunu, jolla hÃ¤n matkusti ""jokaiseen nurkkaan Pohjois-Koreassa keskustellen henkilÃ¶kohtaisesti maanviljelijÃ¶iden kanssaan heidÃ¤n tulevaisuudestaan."" LisÃ¤ksi seinÃ¤llÃ¤ oli kartta hÃ¤nen tekemistÃ¤Ã¤n virkamatkoista ympÃ¤ri maailmaa. Mausoleumilta matka jatkui marttyyrien hautausmaalle, jossa lepÃ¤si vallankumouksen puolesta taistelleita korealaisia. Olin aamulla joutunut ostamaan kukkia muutamalla eurolla tÃ¤tÃ¤ paikkaa varten ja asettamalla kukat haudalle kunnioitin vallankumouksen uhreja. Ilman kukkia haudoille ei kuulemma ole asiaaâ¦ Kukkien osto oli tietenkin ennakkoon jÃ¤rjestetty, sillÃ¤ hotellilta lÃ¤hdettyÃ¤mme kadun varressa odotti tyttÃ¶ kukkakimpun kanssa ja kukat piti ostaa hÃ¤neltÃ¤. Toisaalta mikÃ¤pÃ¤ ei olisi ollut jÃ¤rjestetty koko reissun aikana. Vastaan ei varmasti tullut tilannetta, jota ei olisi etukÃ¤teen sovittu ja siksi mietin useaan otteeseen mikÃ¤ on lavastettua ja mikÃ¤ ihan oikeasti totta. Vierailimme koululla, jossa sain nÃ¤hdÃ¤ koululaisten tekemÃ¤n esityksen. Se esitettiin vain minulle (ja oppaalleni) ja viimeiseen tanssiin jouduin itsekin mukaan. Sotamuseo kÃ¤sitteli Korean sotaa ja kaikesta oikeastaan syytettiin amerikkalaisia. Kellarista lÃ¶ytyi vanhaa sotakalustoa, jotka korealaiset olivat vieneet amerikkalaisilta. MyÃ¶s pari alasammuttua vakoilukonetta oli esillÃ¤, tuorein nÃ¤istÃ¤ helikopteri vuodelta 1990-luvulta. Illalla keskustelin oppaideni kanssa siitÃ¤, mitÃ¤ Koreasta puhutaan ulkomailla. Juteltiin muun muassa etelÃ¤n ja pohjoisen tilanteesta ja siitÃ¤ mitÃ¤ aikaisemmin tÃ¤nÃ¤ vuonna oli tapahtunut. Oppaat kertoivat, ettÃ¤ EtelÃ¤-Korean uponnut sotalaiva upposi itsekseen ilman ulkopuolisia vaikutteita, mutta siitÃ¤ syytetÃ¤Ã¤n heidÃ¤n torpedoiskuaan. Samoin tykeillÃ¤ ampumiset EtelÃ¤-Korean puolelle olivat tavallaan lavastettuja ja EtelÃ¤-Korea oli itse toivonut niitÃ¤, jotta saisi Pohjois-Korean nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n mahdollisimman syylliseltÃ¤. NÃ¤in heille siis on kerrottu.Perjantaina vierailtiin Kaesongissa, joka on kaupunki lÃ¤himpÃ¤nÃ¤ EtelÃ¤-Korean rajaa. Ennen automatkaa sinne pysÃ¤hdyimme kadulle, ojensimme kirjekuoressa viisumirahat samalle oudolle miehelle, jonka nÃ¤in aikaisemmin ja hÃ¤n antoi toisessa kirjekuoressa passini takaisin. HÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤Ã¤ puuhaa, mutta sainpahan ainakin viisumini. Matkalla kaupunkiin oli neljÃ¤ tiesulkua, jolla tarkastettiin, ettÃ¤ paperit olivat kunnossa. Tiet olivat luotisuoria ja huonossa kunnossa, ja parin tunnin ajomatkan aikana vastaan tuli enintÃ¤Ã¤n kymmenen autoa sekÃ¤ kaksi bussia. Kaesongista matka jatkui DMZ:lle eli Demilitarized Zonelle, joka oli erittÃ¤in vartioitu paikka. Ennen alueelle menoa, korealaiset oppaat joutuivat antamaan pois henkilÃ¶korttinsa ja kyselinkin jÃ¤lkikÃ¤teen oliko syynÃ¤ se, etteivÃ¤t he pysty karkaamaan etelÃ¤n puolelle, mutta se oli vain heidÃ¤n oman turvallisuutensa vuoksi... Yhden rakennuksen parvekkeelta tuli nÃ¤htyÃ¤ valtava EtelÃ¤-Korean lippu liehumassa vuorilla ja toisella puolella nÃ¤kyi pienempi Pohjois-Korean lippu. Oppaani kertoi, ettÃ¤ Koreoilla on rauhanomainen suhde ja ne haluavat jatkuvasti yhdistyÃ¤, mutta ainoa este tÃ¤lle on amerikkalaiset. TÃ¤hÃ¤n liittyen luin erÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ pohjoiskorealaisesta lehdestÃ¤ siitÃ¤, kuinka USA ja EtelÃ¤-Korea jÃ¤rjestivÃ¤t jonkun aikaa sitten historian suurimman sotaharjoituksen pelkÃ¤stÃ¤Ã¤n Pohjois-Koreaa vastaan. YleensÃ¤ paikkoja, joissa vierailtiin, esittelivÃ¤t paikalliset oppaat, joiden puheen englanniksi kÃ¤Ã¤nsi oma oppaani. Suurimmalla osalla heistÃ¤ oli pÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤Ã¤n kansallispuku tai univormu. SiinÃ¤ nyt olivat oikeastaan Korean turistinÃ¤htÃ¤vyydet, jotka jokainen nÃ¤kee sinne mentyÃ¤Ã¤n. Seuraavaksi kerron vÃ¤hÃ¤n muita ajatuksia ja kokemuksia paikasta.Kiinnitin huomiota kadulla kÃ¤velevien ihmisten ryhtiin: yhtÃ¤Ã¤n koukkuselkÃ¤Ã¤ ei varmasti tullut vastaan ja vanhempien henkilÃ¶iden ryhti oli parempi kuin yhdenkÃ¤Ã¤n suomalaisnuoren. Tuli mieleen vÃ¤hÃ¤n armeija tÃ¤stÃ¤, mutta erityisesti siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ ihmiset kÃ¤velivÃ¤t kadulla muodossa. Ihmiset nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t samalta harmaalta massalta, eikÃ¤ kukaan erottunut joukosta. NÃ¤kymÃ¤t kaupungilla toivat mieleeni 1950-60-luvun vanhoine rakennuksineen, busseineen ja raitiovaunuineen. Hotellilla ravintolassa istuin aina samalla paikalla ja ravintolassa samat pÃ¶ydÃ¤t oli aina katettu, mutta pÃ¶ydissÃ¤ istui joka ruokailulla eri henkilÃ¶itÃ¤. Silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in mulla oli tunne, ettÃ¤ mun syÃ¶mistÃ¤ seurataan, mutta sama tunne oli toisinaan ihan kadulla kÃ¤vellessÃ¤kin. Istumapaikkani oli aivan kÃ¤ytÃ¤vÃ¤n vieressÃ¤ ja ohi kulki tasaisin vÃ¤liajoin tarjoilijoita tarjottimet tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ ruokaa. En tosissaan tiedÃ¤ minne kaikki ruoka kuljetettiin, sillÃ¤ ruokasaliin se ei ainakaan pÃ¤Ã¤tynyt. MielessÃ¤ kÃ¤vi oliko kyseessÃ¤ halu nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ ettÃ¤ ""meiltÃ¤ lÃ¶ytyy ruokaa,"" vaikka ei sitÃ¤ kenellekÃ¤Ã¤n tarjoiltu. Joka aterian jÃ¤lkeen oppaat kysyivÃ¤t oliko ruoka hyvÃ¤Ã¤ ja oliko sitÃ¤ riittÃ¤vÃ¤sti, ja kerran erehdyin sanomaan, ettÃ¤ jÃ¤i vÃ¤hÃ¤n nÃ¤lkÃ¤ ja tÃ¤mÃ¤n jÃ¤lkeen sain joka aterialle ekstralautasellisen lihaa. MyÃ¶s aamupalalle.HerÃ¤Ã¤minen ensimmÃ¤isenÃ¤ aamuna orkesterin soittoon ei jÃ¤Ã¤nyt ainoaksi vaan herÃ¤sin siihen joka aamu. Jo ennen seitsemÃ¤Ã¤ kuulin saman naisen huudot kaiuttimista ja seiskan pintaan orkesteri alkoi soittaa. Kyselin oppailta mitÃ¤ se on ja kuulemma se on kannustuspuhe vallankumouksen puolesta (ei suinkaan uuden vallankumouksen, vaan saman, jonka he kokivat 1940-luvulla.) Orkesteri samalla soitti kannustusmusiikkia, jotta ihmiset tajuaisivat elÃ¤mÃ¤nsÃ¤ tarkoituksen. Asiaa auttoivat punaiset ""vallankumouksen"" liput, jota ihmiset heiluttivat musiikin tahtiin. LievÃ¤Ã¤ aivopesua. ViimeisenÃ¤ iltana tuli keskusteltua myÃ¶s poliittisista nÃ¤kemyksistÃ¤, karkureista ja tyÃ¶leireistÃ¤. Kysyin siitÃ¤ siihen, miksi ihmiset haluavat karata pohjoisesta etelÃ¤Ã¤n. Vastaus oli, ettÃ¤ he ovat tehneet jotain laitonta Koreassa ja karkaavat rangaistusta. Kuulemma ""normaalit"" korealaiset eivÃ¤t nÃ¤e syytÃ¤, miksi pitÃ¤isi yrittÃ¤Ã¤ karata. TyÃ¶leirit myÃ¶nnettiin ja niille kuulemma joutuvat ainoastaan ne, jotka tekevÃ¤t rikoksia. Koreassa on oppaiden mukaan vapaa sana ja poliittisia vankeja ei ole olemassaâ¦ Kuulin myÃ¶s, ettÃ¤ kaikkia turisteja pidetÃ¤Ã¤n lÃ¤htÃ¶kohtaisesti amerikkalaisina vakoojina kun he tulevat Koreaan.Ihmiset olivat todella kiinnostuneista rahasta ja matkan hintaa Pohjois-Koreaan kysyttiin usein, samoin kuin kameran arvoa. MyÃ¶s palkoista oltiin kiinnostuneita ja toinen oppaista sanoi, ettei usko ettÃ¤ olen matkalla omilla rahoillani, sillÃ¤ kukaan ei voi noin nuorena ansaita riittÃ¤vÃ¤sti rahaa kiertÃ¤Ã¤kseen maailmaaâ¦ Koreassahan kaikki on yhteistÃ¤ ja kenellÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n ei voi olla liikaa rahaa. Kuulemma tyÃ¶ajat ovat kaikilla samat klo 9-18, jos oikein muistan. Valtio tarjoaa asunnon ja kaiken mitÃ¤ elÃ¤miseen tarvitsee, joten palkat eivÃ¤t ole suuria. Yritin kysellÃ¤ palkoista, mutta on kuulemma kiellettyÃ¤ puhua niistÃ¤. MyÃ¶s Pohjois-Korean wonin kÃ¤sittely ulkomaalaisilta oli kielletty eli kaikki maksut tehtiin euroilla tai juaneilla. Puhuin kuitenkin toisen oppaan vaihtamaan kanssani euroja woneiksi ja onnistuin salakuljettamaan maasta jonkun verran korean valuuttaa. Iltaisin klo 18.30 jÃ¤lkeen autolla ajaminen ilman erikoislupaa oli kielletty bensan sÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤miseksi. Muutaman kerran meidÃ¤n pysÃ¤ytettiinkin, mutta poliisin huomatessa minut saatiin jatkaa matkaa papereita nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤. Katuvaloja oli vain pÃ¤Ã¤kaduilla ja useat korttelit olivat illalla pimeinÃ¤. SÃ¤hkÃ¶katkoja tapahtui pÃ¤ivittÃ¤in; ensimmÃ¤isen kerran lentokentÃ¤llÃ¤, pariin otteeseen museoissa ja ravintolassa. Hotellilla sÃ¤hkÃ¶t taisivat katketa jopa 4 kertaa. Kysyin, tapahtuuko tÃ¤tÃ¤ usein ja vastaus oli ettÃ¤ ei tietenkÃ¤Ã¤n, nyt on vaan ollut poikkeuksiaâ¦ KÃ¶yhyyttÃ¤ ei nÃ¤kynyt Pyongyangissa, mutta maaseudulla sen huomasi. Kaikki vaikutti jotenkin tosi alkeelliselta! Esimerkiksi sÃ¤hkÃ¶tolppia ei ollut kaikkialla, vaan jossain paikoissa sÃ¤hkÃ¶langat oli kieritetty posliinikappaleeseen ja ripustettu puuhun. Rakennukset ja tiet olivat tosi huonossa kunnossa kaupunkien ulkopuolella.Kuvat presidentistÃ¤ ja johtajasta olivat esillÃ¤ kaikkialla, jopa metrovaunun seinÃ¤llÃ¤! Kuvissanikin henkilÃ¶t esiintyvÃ¤t muutamaan otteeseen; pystyykÃ¶ joku laskemaan kuinka monta kertaa? HeitÃ¤ arvostettiin ihan mielettÃ¶mÃ¤sti ja kukaan ei kuulemma koskaan ole sanonut mitÃ¤Ã¤n pahaa heistÃ¤. Joko johtaja tai aikoinaan presidentti tekivÃ¤t isoja lahjoituksia ""omista varoistaan"" ja ihmiset olivat erittÃ¤in kiitollisia niistÃ¤. PresidentillÃ¤ oli sÃ¤velkorvaa ja hÃ¤n sÃ¤velsi useita kappaleita. HÃ¤n toimi myÃ¶s elokuvaohjaajana kuten aikaisemmin kerroin. Johtajankin taidoista yritin kysellÃ¤ sarkastisesti, mutta en saanut kysymykseen vastaustaâ¦Olen kÃ¤yttÃ¤nyt tekstin kirjoittamiseen varmaan kohta kolme tuntia ja pahoittelen kaikkia mahdollisia kirjoitusvirheitÃ¤. AsiavirheitÃ¤ tekstissÃ¤ ei pitÃ¤isi olla. KÃ¤ytÃ¤n usein lainausmerkkejÃ¤ tai sanaa ""kuulemma,"" koska en tosissaan jaa kaikkia ajatuksia, joita oppaani minulle kertoivat. Matka oli erilainen mutta mielenkiintoinen kokemus. Sain Korean matkatoimiston kÃ¤yntikortin, sillÃ¤ kerroin mahdollisesti jÃ¤rjestÃ¤vÃ¤ni ryhmÃ¤matkan Koreaan joku vuosi. Asiasta kiinnostuneet voivat olla yhteydessÃ¤ minuun. Jos on muutenkin jotain kysyttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ liittyen Koreaan (tai mihin tahansa muuhun) niin saa kysellÃ¤ vapaasti!"
"A nice morning start - 9am, our first visit was to the less visited areas of hilly rural landscape of Yungshuo, to see where the local farmers live and work.  The house quite large, had a family of four living there, as the children had moved to the city to work.Â Â  One of the gentleman aged 69 was actually in the show the night before, he carried the bamboo boats, he was quite cheeky, showed us how he does weights each day, then showed us his bird that did flips when he told it too.Â Â  The oldest lady of the house showed us through the home, had us grind tofu, pump water, and showed us the snake and centipede wine that was famously made in this area.Â Â  The kitchen we saw and the bedrooms, along with the place that the coffins are kept in a back room for the elderly (an odd tradition but they arrange this as they get older).  The experience was really friendly, gave us a warm feeling of how happy people can be with the most simple of lifestyles.  We had photos taken, and the eldest of the ladies, held your hand as you walked past or gave you the biggest of hugs when you had a photo with her.  Lots of giggling, which just made you laugh, it was a really nice experience, probably one of the best days of the trip.We were then taken to the rice fields, were we saw harvesting, water baffalos with their calves, and beautiful scenery as the fields are set amid limestone peaks, surrounded by meandering river ways, it provided an interesting contrast to the big Chinese cities we'd travelled from.We stopped for lunch on the way back to Guilin, and then stopped at the South China Sea Pearl Exhibition Centre, an interesting museum of where and how the pearls are harvested in China, then we had a fashion parade of beautiful girls in stunning dresses, wearing the pearls they did harvest and set (Freshwater and Sea Pearls), a clever way to display pearls I thought, instead of a movie.Â Â Â Â  Yep, we shopped here, amazing prices as you can imagine, because of the Chinese exchange and because of onsite wholesale shop.The afternoon was a visit to the Reed Flute Cave, during the Japanese invasion in the 1940's it was used as a hideout, today it has tunnels winding through Guangming Hill, inside numerous rock formations, lit with neon lights.Â Â Â  The caves were spectacular, your imagination had to run wild to give names to the formations.We had a few hours at the hotel, our room this time had a view onto the river, we watched the locals swim across just before dark and early in the morning.  Â We then all walked down the market street to a restaurant that served Western meals, just for a change from the daily chinese lazy suzi bouquets.Â Â  I had beef, surprisingly very nice, although still had a touch of Chinese flavour, all cooked by a Chinese.  Our night finished with a visit to see the Cormorant Fishing, we all climbed on a boat to watch the fishermen set off on bamboo rafts, after dark (as the birds don't have good eyesight at night, so it stops them from flying away).Â Â  It's amazing to watch, the cormorants wear collars to prevent them from swallowing the large fish, the birds swim just below the surface alongside the raft towards a light hanging from the bow.  When the bird makes a catch, it returns to the boat and then fisherman retrieves from the bird's beak.Â Â  We were surprised how big the birds were and the actual fish they caught, probably 20 to 30cms.Â Â  When we returned to the shoreside, we had photo's taken with the birds and the fishermen, the birds are really healthy looking and live for about 25 years, but they only fish for 15 years, apparently the fishermen get quite attached to the birds as they train them from chicks, so they keep the birds, they joke and say they are on a fishermens pension when they do retire.Â Â Â  Photos are not so good because flash could not be used, I did attach some so you could get some idea, the focus was on the bird, that is why the fisherman is blurred mostly.Dad and I choose to walk back past the markets and along the main street back to the hotel to see how the locals enjoy a Friday."
"Having looked around at a map of the local tourist spots and after talking to the girls in the business centre of the Hotel, we decided to go to Seven Stars Park in Guilin. We had planned to go to Fubo hill and the Reed Flute Cave today, however having looked at the local area map we realised that they were on opposite sides of the city. Alternatively, the Seven Stars Park seemed to have all of the above and more in one convenient place and close enough via taxi,..."
"Hello from Guilin, we arrived this afternoon following a 26 hour train journey . . . Made especially enjoyable by our room mate who saw fit to start a loud conversation at 4am thismorning . . . I gave him the angry claire stare and he shut up . . .The panda research centre was brilliant - we saw about 5 groups of pandas of all different ages and got to go into the baby incubation area to see the really little ones. They have succesfully bresd over 90 pandas at the base scince the 70s. Which is a good thing as there are less than 100 left in the wild. We also saw red pandas who put on a bit of a show climbing trees for us.The opera was fun to, there was lots of gongy music and stunning costumes. I really liked the ladies who threw their long sleeves around. The last act was the 'Changing Faces' something peculiar to the area - the performers have several masks on and change them so fast you can't see them move its very impressive. We were glad for our longer than scheduled stay in Chendu (due to silly trains) as we were both quite ill. Nothing 3 days of eating exclusively western food couldn't fix - on the mend now. Let's just say we are picking our street food more carefully, you live and you learn.We just checked into the Wada hostel here in Guilin and plan to go down river in a few days to Yangshuo which is more in the countryside - hope to do some cannoing and cycling. Then onto Hong Kong for about 5-6 days. Anyway chris has just come back from the shop with some nondescript beer - so see you later!Mrs PP.S Sorry for all the trully awefull speling misttakes in the blog so far . . ."
"Guilin + Surrounding Area 22nd Aug - 26th Aug (Day171 - 175) We've arrived in China and it's been a manic five days for us. We haven't had a chance to stop at all. Whilst here we have been to the rice terraces, watched comarant fishing, a Li river cruise and a 20km bike ride round Yangshou. We arrived in Guilin late at night and settled into our hotel for the evening for a busy few days. When we woke up the next day we didn't expect call girls' business cards pushed under the door. no doubt I quickly put them into the bin. We spent our first day wandering around Guilin which happens to be a small city of 5 million people! We were plesantly surprised and found the city quite charming. There are many lakes through it with Pagodas. It isnt quite the quaint and authentic experience that some people are looking for. People drive crazily over here, bicycles have been replaced with silent electric scooters that come whizzing past you on the pavement, at zebra crossings, etc they are everywhere. There is no sense of organisation, which makes for crossing the road very scary. It is not even like Vietnam where you would take a deep breath and cross, hoping that the drivers will drive around you. Here if they see a pedestrian they drive even faster. I know we haven't been here for long but the hawking and the spitting is very disgusting and horrible, I don't think we will ever get used to it. I like seeing the contrast between the huge limestone karsts and modern day China, with huge car showrooms set against these karsts. no sky scrapers though which is nice. The next day we were awoken by our tour guide for our day trip to the Dragon Back's rice terraces. The weather was terrible, raimy and cloudy. We got on to our tour bus which happened to be full of mainly domestic tourists including one woman that had the tightest pair of jeans on, designer sunglasses and six inch heels. I don't think she really knew what she had signed hereself up for but i was looking forward to see how she was going to cope all day in her shoes. Our first stop was a minority village that was famous for the girls having long hair. We opted out of watching the show but our mean tour guide was being very pushy for us to buy tickets. To reach this village we needed to cross a wooden bridge, it was packed with people crossing and the bridge was swaying like mad. Then we noticed the sign ""not more than 15 people at a time"". We weren't surprised that this wasn't enforced and that people do not take any notice of the sign. This is China! Once the circus of the show was over we made our way to the rice terraces. It was very busy and packed with domestic tourists. The weather at first remained very hazy and misty but it cleared up a bit later on during the day. we wandered around just the two of us and found some interesting spots to wait for the mist to go and take photos. The rice terraces were amazing and the view was good. Unfortunately we didn't get the postcard picture. On our way back down we spotted fat smug chinese men being carried in sudan chairs. I can't believe how lazy they are, the hike was merely a hill. There were also many spots were you could dress up in traditional clothes and have your photo taken. All a bit gimicky for me. We also spotted the high heeled woman and noticed that she had to buy a pair of flip flops to walk in... i couldn't help but laugh. The next day with our backpacks packed we waited foranother bus to pick us up for daytrip 2 with the same company for a Li River Cruise. We were picked up in a minivan with the funniest driver. He spent the journey quoting lines out of movies in a dramatic voice. It was the start of a good day. We arrived at the harbour where there were lots of ferries and lots of people. We were thinking this is how it is going to be for the rest of our time in China. Our boat was actually very nice with not too many people on there. The cruise lasted for four hours and the views for spectatular! lots of limestone karsts, very green, water buffaloes and such. It reminded me a bit like Halong Bay. Our tour guide pointed out lots of rocks that looked like ""this animal or that"" but I didn't have the imagination to see it, Chris faired a bit better spotting some horses! The cruise ended in Yangshou where we would spend the next couple of days.Yangshou is very beautiful and tiny. It consists of about 5 streets and is completely surrounded surrounded by the river and limestone karsts. It is very touristy with lots of market stalls, western cafes and even KFC has made it here. That evening we signed up to watch comorant fishing. It was a very interesting and enjoyable experince. It wasn't quite like the HSBC advert. We were in a boat that following alongside a man on a bamboo raft and several comorants. We saw the birds catch several fish. Afterwards we overheard a conversation saying that this is all set up for tourists and that the real fishing takes place in the middle of the night. Our last day we decided to take cycle around the surrounding area following the smaller river (yulong). We expected it to be a well signposted route but we were wrong. We got lost several times and ended up on a dual carriage way. We made it though to the dragon bridge. A helpful woman offered to lead us on the right path back but we were unsure of how geninue her help was. Finally on the right trail we realised why this cycle ride is recommended. The view again was amazing. We cycled past lots of local villages, kids tending to water buffaloes, paddy fields and fish farms. It was great to experience a bit of rural china, as we don't think we'll be going to anywhere else that is going to be similar. Sorry for the long long blog.Much Love xxxxx"
"HejEndnu et lille indlÃ¦g, om Guilin, for at vi kan sÃ¦tte en prik pÃ¥ kortet.I foregÃ¥rs ankom vi sÃ¥ til Guilin, vi kÃ¸rte med sommercamp' bus, da de ogsÃ¥ skulle til Guilin. Her sagde vi farvel og tak for nogle virkelig sjove og oplevelsesrige dage med bÃ¸rnene. Vi fandt et hostel nÃ¦r en stor sÃ¸, hvor der er lavet efterligninger af kendte broer fra hele verden, som man kan gÃ¥ over. Det var isÃ¦r flot om aftenen med alle neonlysene som oplyste broerne og palmer og trÃ¦er rundt om sÃ¸erne. Guilin var i turistbÃ¸gerne beskrevet som noget sÃ¦rligt og lle kinesere vi har mÃ¸dt har peget pÃ¥ netop denne by som et godt turistmÃ¥l. Men den var nu mere endnu en storby, meget hyggelig men ikke noget at fremhÃ¦ve, nÃ¥r vi er kommet fra Yangshuo som var noget helt specielt og hyggeligt."
"Darn biorhythms ... I am cursing my family doc right now, :)!China is very much a cash society; unfortunately the hotels where we've been staying, transportation (train or plane tickets) plus tours require RMB's, credit cards are not an option.  I assume mainland China doesn't trust the use of credit cards & has stuck to the ways they've traditionally done business.We took the night train (hard sleeper) from Wuhan to Guilin (12 hrs).  Now that I know what to expect, the experience was not as annoying as the first.  I still would not recommend it, but the soft sleepers sell out so quickly, during peak season & it's a lot cheaper than flying (217 vs 1000 RMB), plus we are going to fly to Guangzhou on Thursday.  My nephews, Kim & I shared one sleeper whereas, Rafael  & May shared the one next to us.We immediately booked a Chinese cruise down the Li River (Guilin to Yangshuo) by small boat (holds six).  A foreign cruise is more than double the price of a Chinese one & more importantly (we had our own boat).  Despite the cost being lower, you are required to make several tourist stops to different shops and sit through some annoying sales pitch (although in Mandarin).Our first required stop on the tour bus was a Jade manufacturing plant.  We got a brief tour of the different gems found in China.  Yes, I resisted and I  did not purchase anything, but was tempted to purchase a small jade horse pendant (my lunar horoscope year).  Next stop was lunch and then to the small boats.  The entire cruise takes about 2 hours. I'm sure most people have seen the movie Star Wars? The limestone karst hills in Guilin were used as Chewbacca's home world Kashyyk.  It's hills have inspired many Chinese Poets and Painters.  Have you ever meditated? I've taken Spiritquest  courses with Maureen Landry & I remember visualizing this area during   meditation sessions.  It just takes your breath away, words cannot describe the true beauty of these hills, especially when the sun strikes the trees illuminating different shades of green.  You feel tranquil & those things that have been weighing on your mind disappear.  I highly recommend this stop if you are going to visit China.  May's family have been to Cuba & seen the karst hills there, but in her opinion, these are more spectacular since it is surrounded by a river and you get to enjoy a nice boat ride vs driving.  The energy of the area just makes you feel so relaxed & you want to soak it all up ... Or take a quick power nap, ;)!  I have taken lots of pictures & I will show them to you when I return to Canada.Locals try to sell boaters a plastic water shooter.  As you travel down the river you can spray other boats.  May was annoyed when a little kid sprayed her.  We witnessed two boats in full attack, as we passed, everyone was totally drenched! Not a bad way to cool off from another hot August day.  Parts of the Li River are very shallow & it's the first time I've seen wildlife near the water.  Not only did we see ducks, pelicans and seagulls, there were some water buffalo's enjoying a nice swim to cool off from the heat.  We also observed a couple of water caves located on the river.  You can hire another small boat adventure tour to explore them.  The boat operator was pointing to us several key hills: a woman yearning for her husband's return, the eight immortals and a cluster of markings that resemble fish,   among a few.Our cruise ended at Yangshuo, it's become a very popular biking, hiking & mountain climbing excursion for many people.  In fact you can bike to various mountain caves and take boat trips further down the Li River.After a long day beginning with the long train ride to the boat cruise, we relaxed a few minutes in our hotel & headed out for supper. The specialty for this area is fish cooked in beer & spices.  A live fish is brought to your table for your approval since it is sold by weight.  The same thing was done when Bryce & Rafael ordered Kermit (again).  No, I did not have this tonight and stuck to Daffy Duck, :)!These smaller cities have very limited wifi.  The kids go around with their iPod to try and scope out the free spots.  So far no luck in Yangshuo.Next stop is Guangzhou on Thursday - it will be our final week of vacation."
"Ni Hao!Greetings from China. As you may remember, at the end of the last blog post we were about to meet our China tour group... done. Sadly there were no strapping Norweigans, the closest we came was a German called Gitte. In fact the only other two adventurers in the group were a couple of middle-aged Australian sheilas. In total, there were six of us, including 'Wendy' our Chinese tour guide (Wendy's her stage name, as no Westerners can pronounce her real name!).Our journey commenced in beautiful Halong Bay in North Vietnam, where we boarded a private traditional junk boat and set sail to cruise among some of the two thousand limestone peaks. We stopped off in the most impressive cave system we've ever seen - Wookey Hole is more of a mouse hole in comparison, and also took a dip in the South China sea, which proved to be full of jelly fish as Carly can testify. The evening was spent sipping cold beers on the bow of the boat, soaking up the scenery, and getting to know our group. During dinner we listened to Wendy talk about our forthcoming time in China, and she somehow pursuaded Al to eat a fish eye - which he almost enjoyed!We weren't too disheartened to wave farewell to Vietnam, although we will miss random men trying to pursuade Al to mount their motorbike by hollering 'Easy rider?'... After a successful and terror free border crossing, our first stop in China was the Butterfly Valley in Hua Shan. The countryside was staggering with so many mountain peaks it felt like you were seeing double, and the deepest green we've seen. Our preconception of China beforehand was polluted, busy cities - a concrete jungle, we'd never given any thought to the countryside. The farmers in this area still use buffalo to plough the rice fields, it really felt like we'd stepped back in time. They also don't get many foreigners so we also caused quite a stir amoungst the locals. Wendy also introduced us to the national game 'Mahjong' which you'll all be subjected too when we return - something to look forward to. We spent the night in the business mecca of Liuzhou to break up the travelling, here we tried stinky tofu (essentially mouldy tofu - but tastes better than the 'normal' tofu) and Carly got stuck in with some impromptu street dancing in the park.Chengyang is home to the Dong nationality and undoubtedly one of the most special places in China, because of its Wind and Rain Bridge which was built without a single nail and sticky rice as cement over 100 years ago. We stayed in a really old wooden guesthouse in a village that is the epitome of a traditional Chinese village. Chengyang also provided us with 'Uncle Wu' who didn't speak a single word of English, but had more charisma than Elvis (and looked a little like him too). He liked to speak at a deafening volume, was plagued by unpredictable head movements and was constantly drunk on wax berry wine. Uncle Wu - we miss you. Chengyang is also home to the loudest roosters of all time; who don't just crow in the morning, they're crowing all the live long day and night. Carly actually gave up vegetarianism to launch a hate campaign against these sleep depriving b******s.We won't call this a highlight, but a stand out moment of our time there featured us attempting to devour a Century Egg. This is a chicken or duck egg which has been buried under the ground for a long long time, (we're talking months) so much so that the egg white turns into a black translucent jelly and the egg yolk is transformed into a creamy gooey green/grey mess that smells of amonia. The Chinese love this: Al bravely swallowed two bites, while Carly couldn't cope with the texture and threw up in her mouth.After an amusing public bus ride, which felt like a London tube carriage at rush hour, we arrived at perhaps the most beautiful place we've visited so far - the Longji Rice Terraces (if ever there was a time to open up a new browser and google image something... it's now people). This man-made wonder is 600 years old and was amazingly created using just basic hand tools. The Yao women who live here are fascinating because they cut their hair only once in their lifetime at age 18. Many have tresses that stretch past their ankles and all are very proud of their roots... ahem. We met some Yao women during a 4 hour trek to our second nights accommodation in a neighbouring village, which was the best way to soak up the magical scenery. Our last destination before Hong Kong was Yangshuo... where a lot went down, including: - A great bike ride to the fampus Moon Mountain and the Li River - We dabbled in Chinese healing by receiving a reflexology session and a painful dose of hot cupping. The cupping resulted in some very disturbing black and red bruises which are still present (6 days after but thankfully now fading). Well, we did say we would try to experience everything!- Had a T'ai Chi lesson by the Li River. T'ai Chi is quite addictive and seems surprisingly practical, plus its reportedly the key to a long life with good balance. Who's with us? China as a whole is notorious for two things: smoking and spitting, and often at the same time. While we could generally handle this outside, we found one gentleman who insisted on spitting on the floor within the restaurtant, mid meal. Not cool. It's actually illegal to spit, but this is not enforced and doesn't put anybody off.Our time in China ended in an exciting way as we experienced our first sleeper train. Owing to our youth, agility, and some would say ravishing looks, we were each assigned the top bunk out of a tier of three. It was a great experience and featured some good people watching. This editions fun fact: at any one time, over 10million people in China are travelling by train. Boom.China took us by surprise, and we enjoyed it far more than we thought we would. There's a lot that's diffuclt to deal with here of course, but what we saw on this trip showed us a different China to our preconceptions. A big part of this has to down to Wendy (our guide) who made us laugh every time she spoke (unintentionally) and was always on hand to feed us not only food, but China-isms. The food has been outstanding, with not a sweet and sour chicken ball in sight, and a wide variety of dishes. We're even slightly addicted to a Chinese breakfast of steamed buns and noodles... although they can keep the egg soup and rice gruel.This doesn't really fit in with the blog... but we'd like to share this with you. The kids here don't wear nappies. Instead, at four months old, toilet training begins by the parents teaching their kid (one child rule and all that) 'to go' by whistling at them. Nappies are replaced with shorts equipped with a split from front to back for easy depositing. It was quite a shock see this for the first time, but we're actually in full support and are quite impressed with the system. However, there was an occassion where a kid pooped in a hat at a bus station... plain old distrubing.You'll all be thrilled to know the next post is just days away as we're planning on updating before we leave Hong Kong, there should be some more pictures too.We were shocked and saddened by the news of the riots in the UK and hope no one was directly affected. It felt strange to be so far away when all the madness was happening, but we were thinking of you all. Love to allxx"
Yesterday we went on a cruise on the Li River for four hours.  The scenary was pretty amazing how ever the sky was very hazy and cloudy so we couldn't see very far.  Went to a small town called Yangshao which was interesting.  We went for a walk at night and saw the pagodas lit up.  It felt surprisingly safe wandering around late at night with kids out and much happening.  We had dinner at a very busy restaurant at midnight where they spoke no english.  Smoking i...
"Guilin - ChinaToday I finally get to do some much needed exercise.  Nothing beats a 10k bike ride with a bit of bamboo rafting and lunch.It was a nice early start of 8am, but I would rather cycle below 30 degrees than above it, it you get me.  So we took a nice scenic route outside of Guilin.  It was a short ride of 1 hour, with photo opportunities along the way.We soon arrived at the bamboo rafting start point and the journey down stream was around 1.5 hou..."
"Nu har vi lige checket ud fra hostlet og skal med nattoget til Hangzhou i aften.I gaar var vi i Roer floejte drypstenshulen. Vi koerte med bus derud og havde ingen ide' om hvor vi skulle staa af. Ved at stopsted kiggede alle kineserne i bussen paa os og pegede over mod doeren, smilede til os og sagde ting paa kinesisk. Vi havde ikke overhovedet ikke snakket om hvor vi skulle af, men de vidste det aabenbart allesammen alligevel. Flinke er de, de kinesere! Grotte..."
"Drie dagen Guilin, Wanneer we aankomen op het vliegveld is het al zes uur. Het is rustig op het vliegveld. Er staat een rij taxi's en er is een mevrouw van het toeristen informatie bureau. We hebben wel een naam van een hotel waar we naar toe willen. Volgens de dame van het informatie centrum kunnen we dat wel vergeten, het is vast vol. We zijn blij dat ze engels spreekt en laten haar een ander hotel regelen. Waarschijnlijk is het hotel wat wij in gedachten hadden helemaal niet vol. Deze gedachten komt pas veel later bij ons op. Maar voor het eerste moment was het eigenijk wel fijn. Ze regelt ook een grotere bus voor ons om met z'n allen in 1 auto te passen en niet met twee taxi's te moeten. Het hotel is prima. Zonder ontbijt, We bedenken dat we dit wel buiten het hotel kunnen halen. We hebben eigenlijk geen van de ochtenden een normaal ontbijt kunnen vinden. Althans geen westers ontbijt. De laatste dag hebben we na lang zoeken een plekje gevonden waar ook frenchtoast te krijgen was of een scrambled egg. Helaas waren wij er om 12uur, dan gaat de lunch kaart in. Guilin is vrij toeristisch, vooral veel chinese toeristen liepen er rond. Te herkennen aan de grote camera op hun buik. De ene camera nog flitsender dan de andere. Dat zag je ook al in Hongkong. Het heeft mij aangestoken. Mijn kleine camera ging een beetje moeilijk doen. Had gelijk een goed excuus om een nieuwe camera te kopen. Door mijn hebberigheid heb ik mij laten lijden, het is een spiegelreflex geworden. Niets meer even snel in mijn tas. Maar ach, wie heeft dat nu nodig. Daar heb ik toch mijn Iphone voor of anders mijn oude cameraï.  Al rondlopend als een echte toerist overal foto's van makend zijn we de eerste dag door Guilin gelopen. De Li River is een van de redenen geweest om voor Guilin te kiezen. Hier kun je een boottocht van een paar uur op maken varend langs de meest schitterende berglandschappen. Ook wel heel erg fijn voor de kinderen. Zij kunnen een beetje rondhangen op de boot en Ds'en wij vooral genieten van om ons heen kijken en even de rust. Alleen zo'n tour, zijn wij alletwee toch wel allergisch voor. Om acht uur 's ochtends werden we al opgehaald bij ons hotel. Kregen daar gelijk onze Pandasticker uitgedeeld en die moesten we toch zeker wel opdoen, anders liep het niet goed met ons af. We zouden verdwalen in Yangshou, het eindpunt van onze boottocht, vanwaar we weer met de bus terug naar Guilan gingen. Ons er toch maar bij neergelegd en nergens meer over nagedacht. Ergens ook wel prettig, normaal ben je bezig met hoe of wat en wanneer dan precies. Nu hoef je niet meer na te denken. In dit gedeeldte van China wordt o.a. gebruik gemaakt van vogels om vis te vangen. Tis wel een beetje zielig. Het zijn vogels die normaal gesproken een vis vangen door aan te komen vliegen en een duikvlucht naar het water maken, zo een grote vis oppikken en opeten. Nu echter zit er een band om hun hals. De grote vis pakken ze nog wel, alleen het doorslikken gaat niet meer. Als beloning krijgen ze van de zogenaamde vissers, kleine visjes gevoerd.Ook hier zijn de kinderen weer een bezienswaardigheid. Pepijn heeft al een poseerhouding aangenomen, Jasmijn groeit ook wel in haar rol als fotomodel en Mila weet steeds beter de aandacht te ontwijken. Op straat lopen hele aardige mensen rond met allemaal hetzelfde verhaal. Ze vragen waar je vandaan komt. En vervolgens vertellen ze dat ze in Oktober naar, heel toevallig dat land toegaan om les te geven. Vragen dan of je thee lust en een theeceremonie wilt meemaken. Na het thee drinken nemen ze je mee naar ""hun"" atelier, waar toevallig een meester in de schilderkunst is. Zo kom je dan aan je lekkere thee en je naam in het Chinees geschilderd door een echte meester. We kwamen er later achter dat dit verhaal voor iedere toerist geldt. Ondanks dat was het toch heel leuk. Jasmijn en Mila zijn heel blij met hun naam in het Chinees en de thee die we gekocht hebben is echt lekker.De derde dag in Guilin, vliegen we aan het eind van de middag naar Chengdu. w***o en ik zijn hier negen jaar geleden al eerder geweest. Ben benieuwd of we het herkennen. We zijn toen in zoveel verschillende plaatsen geweest. We weten eigenlijk niet meer welke Chendu was."
"Matka jatkui bussilla kohti ""pikkupaikkaa"" eli Guilinia. Me siis tosiaan kuviteltiin menevÃ¤mme ihan pikkupaikkaan, mutta nÃ¤issÃ¤ Kiinan pikkupaikoissakin asuu lÃ¤hemmÃ¤s miljoona ihmistÃ¤ kuten tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ Guilinissakin. Ekana pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ oltiinkin sitten puolet pÃ¤ivÃ¤stÃ¤ hieman eksyksissÃ¤ eli siis lÃ¤hettiin tÃ¤ysin vÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤Ã¤n suuntaan paineleen hostellilta. No lÃ¶ydettiin me sentÃ¤Ã¤n semmonen mukava puisto sillÃ¤ reissulla ja syÃ¶tiin kanan varpaita jotka oli yli tulisia. Seuraavana pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ lÃ¤hettiin Li riveriÃ¤ pitkin kohti Yangshuaa. Semmonen about 3 tunnin matka veneellÃ¤ sinne hienojen maisemia katsellen ja maistellen hirveitÃ¤ ruokia mitÃ¤ jotkut kiinalaiset meille tunki. Aijjoo ja opittiin, ettÃ¤ joudutaan oleen joka paikassa kiinalaisten kuvattavana, toisin sanoen meistÃ¤ on jo satoja kuvia eri kiinalaisilla ja itellÃ¤ on joku muutama..... TÃ¤n venematkan piti pÃ¤Ã¤ttyÃ¤ tosiaan Yangshuaan, mutta eipÃ¤ se pÃ¤Ã¤ttynykkÃ¤Ã¤n vaan jouduttiin viÃ¤ about tunti kÃ¶rÃ¶tteleen bussilla sinne. Yangshua on kiva nÃ¤tti pieni backpakker paikka jossa vois mennÃ¤ kiipeileen ym. mutta me nyt ei ehitty muuta kun syÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤ pahaa ruokaa ja kierteen ympÃ¤riinsÃ¤ ja katteleen paikkoja ja illalla otettiin bussi taas takas Guiliniin.Vika pÃ¤ivÃ¤ Guilinissa meni kattellen jotain nÃ¤htÃ¤vyyttÃ¤ ja ettien tyynyjÃ¤ ja ruokaa junamatkalle. Saatiin myÃ¶s hyvÃ¤Ã¤ ruokaa kerrankin, tosin se johtu siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ syÃ¶tiin japanilaisessa ravintolassa eli ei viÃ¤lÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n hyvÃ¤Ã¤ kiinalaista ruokaa. Illalla tosiaan lÃ¤hettiin sitten 30 tunnin junamatkalle hard seateillÃ¤ kohti Xiania. Kiinalaiset kuljetti mukanaan kyllÃ¤ kaikkee ihan kummaa mm. ihme perunasÃ¤kkejÃ¤ ja muovivateja ym+ tietysti hirveet sÃ¤killiset ruokaa...... Matka ei loppujen lopuks ollu ees niin paha kun ois voinu kuvitella, ehkÃ¤ meijÃ¤n tyynytkin autto tÃ¤ssÃ¤ vÃ¤hÃ¤n ja se, ettÃ¤ ei ehkÃ¤ oltu maailman mukavimpia vierustovereita :D"
"Guilin & Yangshuo: 10-15 May.So, back into China. It's only 250 miles northeast from Hanoi to Nanning but it takes 12 hours on the daily overnight train which is cunningly timed so that you hit the border at 2am. After an hour sat in a waiting room on the Vietnamese side while everybody gets stamped out of the country, it's a short trip down the line to experience a Chinese waiting room for another hour while you get stamped in and your luggage x-rayed. We did manage to get some sleep again though before pulling into Nanning later in the morning.We weren't stopping in Nanning and only had a short lay-over until the next train further north to Guilin, a mere 7-hour jaunt on thinly padded, bolt upright seats. The time actually passed quite quickly and we were checking into our hotel in Guilin before dark, nicely situated on the banks of the Li River, but feeling like we had lost a day. First impressions of a Chinese city (other than Beijing and Hong Kong of course) are that they are markedly more developed/advanced than the Vietnamese cities we'd just left behind. There are more cars on the road (including European makes, though still lots of bikes); traffic seems less crazy with less honking and more law-abiding and there are actual shops as we would know them with recognisable brands rather than the market-stall type that were common in Vietnam. Much like home really. Guilin is situated in one of the most naturally beautiful parts of China (âthe finest scenery under heavenâ), surrounded by limestone hills, similar to those dotted throughout Halong Bay. We spent a day checking out some of the sights in Guilin including a big, 800m long cave inside one of the peaks (handy because it was raining), with colourful lighting illuminating the various rock formations and even an underground market to try and coax a few more yuan out of you. We also arranged a cruise down river to the town of Yangshou the following day and our onward rail tickets (the railways are over-subscribed, so booking ahead is recommended).Our guide for the cruise to Yangshou picked us up at 8am and we joined the bus heading to the quay (we weren't first on for a change so didn't have to stop at too many other hotels!). Our guide was called Yang Yang, though said his 'western name' was Daniel. Does that make my Chinese name Yang Yang too? I didn't ask as he was quite an excitable fellow already! This was touring Chinese-style and our bus was designated Team Panda. We put on our panda stickers and dutifully followed Yang Yang's panda flag through the ticket queues and onto the right boat and ventured onto the upper deck to admire the view. In the rain. After boasting to Chris halfway up Vietnam that we could count rainy days on our trip on one hand, it seems to have been raining at least every other day since. The wet season's on the way and seems to be racing us northwards.It's 80km downstream from Guilin to Yangshou, taking about 4-5 hours on the fast-flowing river. Despite the weather, the scenery was great and Yang Yang was working hard making sure that we all saw the best views and (with vast amounts of imagination) the formations/patterns forming '9-Horse Fresco Hill' and 'Celestial Being' and the like. Lunch was included on the boat â a filling buffet of rice, noodles and meats before we pulled into Yangshou.Yangshou itself is a relatively small town surrounded by farmland amongst the limestone peaks. Tourism is big business and more than 15 million tourists come through here a year; the vast majority of which are Chinese, but there's more than enough westerners so that virtually all of the many restaurants have English menus. We were here for three nights, but with more rain forecast we had signed up for an additional tour with Yang Yang on the afternoon we arrived. We'd signed up in an optimistically dry patch in the weather, but when it came to meeting time, it was bucketing it down again. Yang Yang's spirits were not dampened though and Team Panda rode again.  We stopped at the village of Yulong, just outside Yangshou, where we sheltered from the rain while Yang Yang talked us through village life, recent developments in living standards and the caste system that still seems to apply in certain walks of life. A bit of bamboo rafting followed â we huddled under our borrowed umbrellas while some poor soul punted us along, stopping to feed water buffalo and to see a demonstration of Cormorant Fishing, before returning to Yangshou. Cormorant fishing has been practiced in these parts for hundreds of years; the fisherman sets out on his raft with a couple of trained birds who dive for fish before returning to the raft where the fisherman removes the fish from the bird's throat before throwing the bird back into the water to go fishing again. Ties around the bird's neck prevent them from swallowing the fish, try as they might. The fisherman lets them eat every 8th fish or something. It was fascinating to watch and the birds catch fish so rapidly â apparently one bird can catch up to 50 kilos a day.We spent the next day exploring the town and then a day getting wet and muddy on bikes exploring the countryside. We visited Moon Hill which was about 10km outside of town and on one of the main roads. Fortunately there were bike lanes keeping us from getting squashed by the multitude of tour buses heading back and forth. The hill itself was a steep climb up to the summit where you pass through a massive arch where the weather has eaten a whole through the top of the hill which resembles a rising moon. To avoid the main roads back into town, we took off on the side roads along one of the rivers, passing through remarkable scenery and small villages before getting properly lost when the road we thought would lead us back to town kept narrowing before petering out in a bunch of pig-sties. We'd come too far to double back so used the force instead, negotiating some muddy, pot-holed lanes before hitting a road again. We had time for a hot shower before heading out again to see the open-air show âImpression of Sanjie Liuâ that evening. Set on the river, we'd actually had tickets for the previous day but the show had been cancelled due to the rising water levels and our tickets carried forward. After a tiring damp day on bikes, we walked to the meeting place in the rain expecting (and partially hoping!) that it would be cancelled again and we could get a refund and an early night. No such luck though, the show must go on, so we caught a bus 2km out of town to the permanent show venue. The majority of seats are uncovered and free ponchos are given out with each ticket, so virtually the whole crowd was covered head to toe in the same coloured plastic, looking like some kind of condom-people convention. The show itself features a cast of more than 600 people set on land and water to song, music and lights. It's directed by a renowned film director and is very impressive, but neither of us have any clue as to what the story was and it was a bit slow and arty in places when more dramatic light-shows would have been a bit more entertaining. It's only an hour long, but the number of people who arrived late, got up and wandered around in the middle and/or left early was amazing. Not sure if the Chinese are renowned for short attention spans but a lot of them seemed to have somewhere better to be despite it being an expensive show (Â£25 for the cheapest tickets)! We got back into town quite late and ate in a restaurant with a balcony overlooking the hordes of people walking up and down one of the main market streets.The following day we were catching an overnight train out of Guilin, so it was a short bus ride of about an hour or so back to Guilin where we found a restaurant near the station to shelter from the rain until it was time for our train. It's about 750 miles west to our next stop, Kunming, barely a dent in a country this size. Hopefully it'll be drier there! Nutts: Thanks for your message. You'll be pleased to know that we have added some new entries to the International Sign-Language Handbook, both courtesy of Sue - âDo you have any deodorant in this shop?â (think of the actions from the Superman song) and âCan you take us to the train station?â (think Locomotion by Kylie with train sound effects). Take care all,Dan & Sue"
"Nin hao!Nu har vi vaeret i Guilin, saa det vil vi lige fortaelle en smule om.Vi ankom med toget meget tidligt om morgenen fra Hong Kong. Det var en god togtur, men vi var meget traette da vi ankom. Paa vej ned af preonen blev vi tilbudt hjaelp af en turistinformation. Der er altid lidt tvivl om de reelt er en turistinformation eller bare nogen der vil saelge nogle ture. Det her var vel begge. Klokken var paa dette tidspunkt lidt over 7 om morgenen, saa vi var nemme ofre. Vi endte med at bestille to ture hos dem og ogsaa et hotel. Saa de fik det optimale ud af os, maa man sige. Men det viste sig at vaere nogle fine ture og et ok hotel.Resten af dagen startede med at vi gik ud i byen for at faa noget at spise. Der bor ca 700.000 i Guilin, saa det er en rimelig stor by. Man foeler, i forhold til Hong Kong, at dette er det aegte Kina. Det fandt vi ogsaa ud af, da vi endelig fandt et sted at spise. Der var ingen, der talte bare lidt engelsk. Og vi kunne kun sige Nin Hao til dem. Heldigvis var der billeder af nogle af retterne, saa vi pegede paa noget, som endte med at vaere ret godt. Man kunne ogsaa maerke det aegte Kina paa restauranten i form af den tykke cigaretroeg. Alle maend i Kina ryger - hele tiden og overalt. Kvinderne derimod er mere sky. De fniser hver gang vi kigger paa dem, og ikke mindst naar de lige toer at sige 'bye bye' til os.Efter restauranten forsoegte vi at finde en velkendt park i Guilin, hvor der ogsaa skulle vaere en zoo med pandaer. Det regnede og der var koldt, ca. 12 grader. Det var vi ikke klar paa med vores paaklaedning fra de varme lande vi har vaeret i. Derudover var vores kort haabloes, saa vi endte med at tage en taxi. Selve parken var flot. Guilinomraadet er kendt for flot natur og den fik man en smagsproeve paa her. Zoo'en derimod, den var deprimerende. Pandaen havde det bedst, men virkede trist. Den gik frem og tilbage og stod aldrig stille. Aberne var i et glasbur med betongulv. Men vi fik da set en panda.Efter dette tog vi paa internetcafe. Internetcafeer er en farce i Kina. De er mega store og fyldt med unge kinesere, der ryger meget. Ingen taler engelsk, og ingen hjemmesider virker. Man maa intet paa nettet. Det minder om en fritidsordning, hvor man kun maa spille paa dr.dk. - og ikke mujaffa. Efter dette gik vi paa restaurant. Det var igen en svaer, men interessant oplevelse. Mette bestilte en suppe, og fik en stor gryde med nok til 4 personer. Jeppe fik den klassiske sweet and sour pork, det er godt! Under middagen bliver man som regelt nedstirret af de lokale, det blev vi ogsaa her. Det er sjovt at se en dansker ikke fatte at spise med pinde.Dagen efter var vi paa vores bestilte tur til rismarkerne udenfor Guilin. Det var en god tur, som ogsaa foerte os ind i en landsby, hvor man kunne se hvordan denne minoritetsgruppe boede. Denne landsby var kendt for en tradition med kvinderne, som skulle have utroligt langt haar, som de kun maatte vise naar de blev gift. Men de var ogsaa glade for at saelge ting. Overalt man gik havde vi 5 saeglere bag os, men de var nogle meget soede damer. Der var desvaerre taaget paa risterasserne, saa udsigten kunne have vaeret bedre, men det var rigtig flot.Paa vejen tilbage var vi forbi en teplantage, hvor vi blev vist rundt og havde tesmagning paa den traditionelle kinesiske maade. Teen faldt mere i Mettes smag end Jeppes.Da vi kom tilbage ville vi booke en flybillet til Shanghai. Det var ikke nemt. Flyselskabernes hjemmesider er ikke eget til andre end kinesere, saa det opgav vi efter en time. Saa fandt vi et bookingbureau. De forstod en lille bitte smule engelsk. De brugte ca 20 minutter paa ikke at forstaa oe'et i Mettes efternavn, alt imens Jeppe laerte dem ordet 'passport', men vi blev decideret reddet af en ung pige der kom ind i forretningen. Hun kunne engelsk! Vi fandt ud af at vi havde booket en fly med East Asia, saa det var fint.Dagen efter, som er idag, stod vi igen tidligt op for at komme paa vores naeste tur. En sejltur ned af Li River. Det er noget af det flotteste natur Kina har at tilbyde, og det var virkelig en flot tur. Turen endte i Yuangshu, en by en times koersel fra Guilin. Her skal vi bo de naeste 4 naetter. Det fortaeller vi om senere.Hej, hej!"
"SÃ¥ er det vist tid til en opdatering. Synes bare ikke der sker sÃ¥ meget, sÃ¥ der er noget at skrive, men nu har vinnie og jeg vÃ¦ret pÃ¥ en lille miniferie pÃ¥ 6 dage til Guilin i sydkina. Vi var endda sÃ¥ heldige at fÃ¥ et par dage ekstra fri for at fÃ¥ det til at passe med flyet. Det er nemlig ikke sÃ¥ nemt endda med de fly, men godt man har en god vejleder der hellere end gerne bruger godt og vel en halv time pÃ¥ at booke for os:) NÃ¥ men afsted kom vi. Og det bÃ¸d pÃ¥ mange dejlige oplevelser. Godt nok var vejret ikke sÃ¥ godt som hÃ¥bet, nÃ¥r nu man tager til det sydlige og eksotiske Kina. Det bÃ¸d pÃ¥ en del regn, men der skal mere til at slÃ¥ et par eventyrlystne tÃ¸ser ud. Fredag gik med at rejse og at komme rundt og se Guilin, smat finde vores hostel, der var gemt godt af vejen. Guilin er et stort tivoli af lys om aftenen, det er flot, men lidt for meget. SÃ¥ havde vi hÃ¥bet at skulle se et stort vandfaldsshow, men udstyret var desvÃ¦rre gÃ¥et i stykker. Men vi fik besteget et bjerg der stikker op midt i byen, taget et billede af verden - hvor KÃ¸benhavn ligger i Sverige (det er jo det jeg altid har sagt, sjÃ¦llÃ¦ndere er nÃ¦sten svenskere). Det ser ellers flot ud nÃ¥r de har lavet hele verden i marmor midt pÃ¥ centerpladsen. Ellers stod den pÃ¥ shopping i en masse smÃ¥ boder der bliver stillet op pÃ¥ vejen om aftenen, vejen bliver simpelthen spÃ¦rret af til formÃ¥let.LÃ¸rdag sejlede vi sÃ¥ pÃ¥ Lijangfloden i en bambus wanabee bÃ¥d, det var rigtig flot og det var lÃ¦kkert vejr til det. Det kan virkelig anbefales, man fÃ¥r dog taget alt for mange billeder af bjerge og vand. Efter dette endte vi i Yangshou hvor vi overnattede, her er der virkelig et dejligt natteliv, hvor der bliver handlet pÃ¥ livet lÃ¸s. Vi spiste udenfor pÃ¥ en dejlig restaurant. SÃ¸ndag lejede vi to mountainbikes og begav os pÃ¥ cykeltur, ihÃ¸jgrad offroad, som bare gav nogle gevaldig flotte og sjove oplevelser, indimellem var stien nemlig ikke mere end ca 20cm bred. Og vi kom igennem en masse smÃ¥ landsbyer langs en flod. Om aftenen havde Vinnie samlet sig mod nok til at vi skulle tilbage til vores restaurant og prÃ¸ve at bestille hund til aftensmad - det smager faktisk ganske godt. Mandag drog vi tilbage til Guilin hvor vi sÃ¥ en drypstenshule, shoppede og kravlede rundt i nogle bjerghuler.Tirsdag havde vi bestilt en guidet tur til nogle risterasser kaldet dragens rygrad, da de bugter sig som ryggen pÃ¥ en drage. Men det var desvÃ¦rre sÃ¥ tÃ¥get at det var begrÃ¦nset hvor meget vi kunne se, men lidt af det imponerende landskab kunne vi da skimte, nÃ¥r tÃ¥gen indimellem lettede lidt, for ellers var det faktisk bare et hvidt tÃ¦ppe. Men pÃ¥ turen kom vi ogsÃ¥ op og besÃ¸ge en minoritets landsby med de kendte Yao kvinder, disse kvinder klipper kun deres hÃ¥r nÃ¥r de er 16 Ã¥r (og dette bindes fast oven pÃ¥ hovedet) sÃ¥ deres hÃ¥r er meget langt. Ud over dette skiller disse folk sig ogsÃ¥ ud ved at mÃ¦ndene i disse samfund ikke har noget at skulle have sagt, de mÃ¥ bare gÃ¥ derhjemme og passe bÃ¸rnene mens kvinderne gÃ¥r pÃ¥ arbejde. De lavede et stort show for os, som var meget sjovt. Her niver man bl.a. hinanden bagi for at sige at man godt kan lide den anden, hvilket Vinnie ikke havde opfattet, fÃ¸r de pludselig begyndte pÃ¥ det:) Her fik vi ogsÃ¥ noget lokalt mad der laves ved at stoppe bl.a. ris ind i et bambus rÃ¸r og ligge det pÃ¥ bÃ¥let, hvorefter det serveres i disse rÃ¸r, der flÃ¦kkes pÃ¥ midten. det smagte rigtig godt.Onsdag flÃ¸j vi hjem og fik her lov at opleve hvor utÃ¥lmodige kineserne er, for rÃ¦kke 16-28 skulle boarde fÃ¸rst, men da vi kom om bord var de forreste rÃ¦kker nÃ¦sten fyldt (vi sad pÃ¥ rÃ¦kke 20) og da flyet landede flÃ¸j de op for at finde deres ting fÃ¸r sikkerhedsselerne mÃ¥tte lÃ¸snes. Endelig ved bagagebÃ¥ndet stod de og skubbede og slÃ¥sede om bagagen (vÃ¦rre end set fÃ¸r) og det hentede de hele 4 min pÃ¥ regnede vi ud:) Men alt i alt var det en rigtig lÃ¦kker tur, hvor vi rigtig fik set noget andet en millionbyer. Ellers gÃ¥r det bare rigtig godt hernede og min vejleder bliver ved at fortÃ¦lle mig hvor dygtig jeg er, sÃ¥ det er jo dejligt. Men det var hÃ¥rdt at komme tilbage pÃ¥ arbejde idag."
"Zoals de titel al zegt, we zijn in Guilin (China) aangekomen! Eigenlijk was dat al gisterochtend maar we hebben nog even de tijd genomen om bij te komen. De reis ging soepeltjes. We vertrokken iets te vroeg vanaf Amsterdam, dus we hadden al goede hoop dat we de transfer in Londen zouden halen (waarbij we binnen 2.40u van vliegveld moesten wisselen). Helemaal toen de captain zei dat we ook nog eens eerder aankwamen, maar we wilden niet te vroeg juichen. Onze tassen waren er snel en dus stonden we al met onze tassen om 12.20 klaar..terwijl ons vliegtuig pas om 12.25 zou aankomen. Even zoeken naar de taxichauffeur, wat uiteraard een Indiase meneer was...en die ons langzaam maar veilig...en het belangrijkste OP TIJD naar Heathrow bracht. Mission 1 accomplished.De vlucht naar Doha was erg relaxed. Bijna niemand in het vliegtuig, allerlei films/spelletjes om te kiezen en het eten was echt lekker, ja echt! Met Qatar vliegen was echt super...Op Doha nog even gewacht en toen verder naar Guangzhou. Die vlucht zat een stuk voller maar de mushroom wrap maakte een hoop goed ;) Op Guangzhou werd ons visum goedgekeurd en gingen we rechtstreeks naar het busstation. Met Daniels beste Chinees hadden we zo weer 18 euro bespaard op de taxi (ten opzichte van iemand die alleen Engels speekt). Op het busstation was alles in karakters, dus waar naartoe om een kaartje naar Guilin te kopen?! Een paar Engels-sprekende Chinezen hielpen ons op weg en om 18.00 lokale tijd vertrokken we met de bus. Mission 2 accomplished.De bus was geen normale bus, maar een slaapbus. Dat betekent dat er alleen bedden in de bus zijn, geen stoelen. We sliepen boven (als in een stapelbed) en dus klauterden we erin, om er vervolgens 11uur niet uit te komen. Na die 11 uur waren we om 5uur 's ochtends in Guilin! Taxi gepakt, Laurent gebeld en daar stonden we om half 6 in de huiskamer. Mission 3 accomplished.Bij Laurent blijven we nu tot en met dinsdag. Laurent is een jongen waarmee Daniel in Guilin gestudeerd heeft en die hier nu woont met zijn Chinese vriendin Linda. Het is een echt Chinees appartement, wat betekent dat we een gat in de grond als wc hebben (wat tevens dient als douche), een houten bankstel dat er alleen voor sier staat en een keihard bed waar Daniel goed tegen kan, maar Marloes absoluut niet.Gisteravond zijn we uiteten geweest met een groep die onze sitenaam 'global village' eer aan doet. De groep bestond uit Nederlanders, Limburgers, een Amerikaan, een Duitser, een Vietnamees, een Indonesier, een Chinees en een Mexicaan. Een kleine reunie van twee jaar geleden, met wat new additions. Vandaag hebben we uitgeslapen, straks ff winkelen, noodles eten en vanavond bij de Koreaan een hondje eten en naar de kroeg :) Lekker relaxen voordat we hoeven na te denken hoe we anderen gaan entertainen.This is it for now, maar niet voordat we enkele grappige weetjes met jullie delen:* Chinees meisje in de slaapbus zei tegen Daniel: I am very excited to talk to you, because normally I only see people like you in the movies.* We staan in het winkeltje bij de Universiteits campus, en als de eigenaresse de winkel binnen komt lopen, is het eerste wat ze tegen Marloes zegt: You're so SEXY!* Het was al lang en breed bekend op Universiteit van Guilin dat Daniel zou terugkomen, wat hij precies zo gaan doen hier en met wie.* De eerste varkensneuzen op de markt zijn gespot en Daniel wordt gedrogeerd met Chinese herbal tea om van zn verkoudheid af te komen.* Misschien kan hij beter naar het tentje om de hoek gaan. Daar zitten ze allemaal aan het infuus, alsof ze op de bus aan het wachten zijn. Het schijnt dat het infuus voor alles helpt en een beetje tussen de apotheek en het ziekenhuis in zit."
"The disappointment of missing the 3 gorges cruise meant that we had 6 days spanning over the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival). We had read good things about Guilin and decided to treat ourselves to 6 days in one place.The train journey from Chongqing was uneventful and we arrived at our hostel easily with Guilin being a relatively small city. Temperatures were sub zero which we were assured was unusual for this area and much in the same way we in the UK seldom have air conditioning due to the infrequency of use, buildings in the South of China seldom have heating!Our initial exploration of Guilin was uninspiring as it seemed similar to the centre of many other Chinese cities we had visited, the only bright point was Gemma's discovery of sweet pumpkin buns which she ordered by the plate load.Our first full day yielded much better results, more in tune with what the guide book had lead us to believe about Guilin. We climbed limestone karsts with Ming dynasty pavilions and pagodas at their summits and Buddhist carvings within. The weather and particularly the mist took something away from the otherwise spectacular views of the city but the ascents were still worth it. In the afternoon we took a walk along the Li river and visited the scenic seven stars park.After an evening refuelling with more pumpkin buns the next day we travelled into the countryside to visit the Dragon's Backbone rice terraces an ingenious agricultural feat where by Chinese farmers grow rice on otherwise un-farmable hillsides. Once again we were thwarted by the mists which limited the views but the experience was still worthwhile. During the evening we were back in Guilin to visit its lake on which sit the beautiful Sun and Moon twin pagodas.Whilst Guilin undeniably has some natural beauty it didn't reach our expectations. In addition we found it to be quite developed, lacking in character and offering very little in the way of nightlife. It was New Years Eve and we decided to leave Guilin, take a chance and spend the Spring Festival in the nearby town of Yangshou."
"Even een kleine update van de laatste paar dagen. As we speak zit ik in Guilin ""cappuccino"" te drinken (dat is hier: koffie met melk, slagroom, kaneel en een sinaasappelschilletje) en te wachten op de trein naar Kunming, Yunnan. De afgelopen dagen ben ik dus voornamelijk in Yangshuo geweest, ongeveer 100 km hier vandaan. Een hele vriendelijke gids (Marcel) heeft me hier voor een schappelijk bedrag rondgeleid. Het dorpje is redelijk touristy, maar het was het hele..."
"Today I was supposed to have gone on a tour of Longsheng, to see the terrance rice field and the minority tribes, but there was some mix up resulting that I wasn't able to go there. Instead I went to the old Daxuzhen village, and the Seven Stars Park where I explored the cave there. Tonight I was supposed to catch a plane to Shenzhen but it was delayed by 1 1/2 hours."
Up early and went to breakfast in a central courtyard cafÃ© within the hotel. It was quite a nice atmosphere and obviously designed to be a cool area in the hot season. The temperature was comfortable here at around 17C most of the time and a little cooler at night. The breakfast was a buffet as usual but dad and I just had toast as we are both starting to find it a bit hard to have a full cooked meal every morning! After brekkie we went outside and took a coup...
"From Hangzhou we went to Guilin for a little while, in the hope that as it was much further south it would be hotter. These hopes were dashed by the fact it rained quite a bit whilst we were there.However we did cycle around a fair bit, along the Li river, a load of lakes and such. We went to see some rock/hill that was meant to look like an elephant but we never saw from which way this would be, so a touh disappointing. We also got lost a fair bit whilst there as the map the hostel had given us was rubbish, so we got to see a whole lot of Guilin that we had planned to see.From Guilin we went to see the Dragons backbone rice terraces. These were in essence really cool and quite spectacular except the one full day that we had there, the clouds came right down and you could hardly see. However we did get some nice time outside of the city to walk around in the rain. Stayed in a little village called Tiantou in a hotel where the first night we were the only guests. This had the consequence that the hotel didn't bother with its heating so we had to resort to going to bed at 7 to stay warm!!After that we had another day in Guilin where we got massages and did not so much else. We went to the seven stars park which was nice to have a picnic there, but we went to the caves where we got really ripped off. They were kind of tacky with loads of coloured lights and stuff and we were in a chinese tour so couldn't understand a thing.Left Guilin on the 29th on a train to Shenzhen. This arrived on the 30th and we then had a relatively long wlak through the station and border control before we were in Hong Kong and able to get on the metro."
"Nihao!Guilin blev byen der skulle afloese Yangshuo. For det foerste maa fastslaas, at det ikke er nemt at foelge efter Yangshuo. For det andet havde vi faaet at vide fra alle vi havde moedt, at Guilin slet ikke kunne maale sig med Yangshuo.Vi havde derfor ikke videre hoeje forventninger til byen - faktisk vidste vi ikke om der var mere at se end til en enkelt dag. Da vi denne dag tog til Solitary Beauty Peak (bjerg med huse som tilhoerte en prins fra Qing-dynastiet engang) kunne vi fra toppen se et andet smukt landskab i horisonten. I og med vi ogsaa havde set dette landskab paa plakater etc besluttede vi at tjekke det ud dagen efter. Paa den maade endte vi altsaa med at vaere i Guilin i to naetter.Hoejdepunkter i prioriteret raekkefoelge: At finde en baenkebider i min afsindigt staerke mad, saa jeg slap for at spise den og i stedet gik ud paa gaden og fik min so far bedste street food til absolut ingen penge! Vi snakker koed paa spyd, marinerede og indbagte kyllingestykker, gade-McChicken og portugisiske Egg-tarts(soedlig dessert)!! MUM At slentre rundt om soeen med Sun and Moon Pagoda (billedet) og nyde roen og det smukke skaer. Da vi af en feminin kineserherre blev bydt indenfor til te-smagning hos hans ""kusine"", for at sludre om loest og fast og TE! Saa fortael mig ikke nu, hvordan man skal drikke te, det har Cecilie og jeg temmelig godt styr paa ;)De andre sights var lidt skuffende, for de var baade temmelig dyre og i gang med at blive restaureret :-/Ha' det muntert :)"
"Efter en laekker morgen, hvor vi vaagnede op i billedskoenne Yangshuo, tog vi videre til Guilin - en stoerre ""provinsby"" med blot 700.000 indbyggere... Det er en by, hvor man ikke behoever at vaere i frygteligt mange dage, saa det var lige, hvad der passede ind i vores program.Til aften fandt Christian en bille i sin mad, og det skabte et vaerre postyr ude bagved, kunne vi hoere. Vaerre end jeg havde troet her i Kina, hvor de ellers ikke tager saadan nogle ting, som haar i maden og lignende, saerlig tungt. Saa vi maatte ud og finde billig gademad til Christian, og det var ogsaa lige, hvad han ville have. Han fik lys i oejnene, kan jeg sige jer!Dagen efter havde jeg ogsaa min personlige gademad-debut, da jeg koebte en majskolbe, da vi var inde og se Princes City Scenic Area og Solitary Beauty Peak. Jeg kan love for, at jeg var stolt ;) I denne by har vi ogsaa moedt en masse nye mennesker, og vi blev blandt andet ogsaa inviteret ind i en lokal te-butik for at smage te, som kineserne goer det, foer de ved, hvilket te de vil koebe. Saa paa rigtig kineser-maner smagte vi ellers paa forskellig te, og endte selvfoelgelig med at koebe en lille smule, da vi ikke syntes, vi kunne vaere andet bekendt.. Men godt det var det!I Guilin har vi ogsaa set Sun and Moon Pagodas, som byen er kendt for (se billedet). Det var en rigtig hyggelig aftentur vi fik ud af det, og de var flotte da de var oplyst midt i soeen der om aftenen.Den efterfoelgende dag tog vi ud og saa Elephant Trunk Hill, Chuanshan Park og Pierced Mountain."
"Happy Friday (Thursday where you are),  I hope this blog finds you well.  Today started off with a stroll along the Li River to two of Guilin's pagodas.  There, many people were dancing and doing Tai Chi.  Most of them were older.  It was very interesting seeing the older people exercise and watching them have fun.  The two pagodas, and the lake surrounding them, were featured on the Amazing Race.  After we left the park, we set off on our Li River excursion.  We..."
"Dans le train (Et oui encore!!!) depuis 23 heures, encore 3 ou 5 heures pour arriver a Chengdu oÃ¹ j'espÃ¨re organiser mon voyage au Tibet. Il me faut un permis et je ne pourrai sans doute l'avoir qu'en joignant un tour organisÃ© et avec lequel on n'est pas libre d'aller oÃ¹ on veut. La rÃ©gion de Guilin est superbe. La ville de Guilin en elle-mÃªme n'est pas trÃ¨s intÃ©ressante, plutÃ´t un point de passage mais dÃ©s qu'on sort de la ville, c'est magnifique. J'y ai passÃ© 2 nuits en attendant de prendre un bus ou le train. La premiÃ¨re, Mike et moi avons sympathisÃ©s avec des locaux mangeant Ã  la mÃªme ""cantine"" et buvant du Baijiu. Nous avons faits quelques ""kombai"" avec eux Ã  la biÃ¨re et au baijiu, alcool de riz entre 38Â° Ã  65Â°â¦On a fini dans un bel Ã©tat !Ensuite dÃ©part pour Yangshuo. Nous logeons dans une guesthouse oÃ¹ les repas sont inclus. 1 heure aprÃ¨s notre arrivÃ©e, nous sommes accueillis avec un repas gigantesque. Il y a une dizaine de plats diffÃ©rents (Tofu, champignons, brocolis, poulet au gingembre, bÅuf Ã  la citronnelle...) DÃ©licieux! Pour 70 yuans, lit inclus, ouaw! Le lendemain, rÃ©veil tÃ´t pour marcher 20 km le long de la riviÃ¨re Li. Des bamboos rafts proposent de faire le chemin en bateau mais je veux le faire en marchant. J'ai le temps! Le chemin en vaut la peine en plus! Il a plu les jours prÃ©cÃ©dents alors le chemin est glissant (je ne suis tombÃ©e qu'une fois ). Je ne croise que peu de touristes, juste des habitants de petits villages ravissants. Les paysages sont vraiment Ã  part. Ces rocs immenses, comme tombÃ©s dans la riviÃ¨re, c'est vraiment Ã©trange. Finalement, vers 17h, aprÃ¨s 4h30 de marche, je prends un bamboo raft pour arriver Ã  Yangshuo avant la tombÃ©e de la nuit. C'est sympa aussi et plus reposant.De retour dans la ville, je goute au poisson Ã  la biÃ¨re, la spÃ©cialitÃ© de la ville. C'est bon.Le lendemain, malgrÃ© la pluie, je loue un vÃ©lo pour aller le long de la riviÃ¨re Yulong oÃ¹ le paysage doit Ãªtre encore plus beau que le long de la riviÃ¨re Li selon le Lonely Planet. Et si je ne pensais pas que c'Ã©tait possible, Ã§a l'Ã©tait pourtant. Peu de touristes avaient eu la mÃªme idÃ©e alors nous Ã©tions casi les seuls dans ces minuscules villages. C'Ã©tait vraiment ce que je voulais voir depuis longtemps. Des paysans travaillant dans leur champ, des buffles trainant des chariots de lÃ©gumes ou de riz, des papys et mamies me souriant d'un grand sourire Ã©dentÃ© et surtout ce paysage magnifique. (les photos sont en ligne!) Nous passons au milieu des riziÃ¨res, de lacs, au bord de la riviÃ¨re. C'est ma plus belle journÃ©e en Chine pour le moment... Les pierres, la boue du trajet, m'ont cassÃ©s les bras et le dos et j'aurai bien besoin d'un massage. Ca pourra surement Ãªtre possible en ville pour moins de 5 Euros!"
"Vervolg reis Guilin.. (Heb net in plaats van mijn nieuwe blog gepost, mijn blog gewist!! Hier komt ie opnieuw)De eerste dag in Guilin was dus allesbehalve saai. Gelukkig werd mijn ticket terug naar Beijing voor mij geregeld en hoefde ik mij daar niet meer druk om te maken. 's Avonds heb ik het stadje, het centrum, verkend. Wat een pracht! Zeker aan te raden, zoveel barretjes, restaurants, winkels, souvenir-standjes, veel mensen op straat erg gezellig. De gezell..."
"Longi Rice TerracesI had chosen to take a day tour from Guilin to the rice terraces in the mountains. I was a little bit concerned that I might be the only one going when nobody was around when the tour guide was supposed to come and collect me, but I need not have worried. A French couple joined me from the hostel and then we joined a whole bus load of Chinese! I had imagined a little minibus from the hostel, but we had a 50 seater coach.The drive to the ter..."
"What a bizarre experience....we all headed off to Guilin this morning for our Chinese health check to get our Residents Permit (currently we are foreign aliens!!). I've been a RN for nearly 30 years and never have I experienced such an examination. We were split into groups of 3 and then headed off into different rooms, no-one spoke any English and we were prodded along like cattle. Some of us got the giggles and ended up with stern looks from one of the doctors ..."
"16. juliUden saa mange timer paa ryggen natten foer var dr doemt restituering - vi tog et tiltraengt bad, fik et ordenligt maaltid og daskede lidt rundt i omraadet. Vi besluttede for at se en af de faa attraktioner i Guilin by; nogle bronze Pagodaer, to hoeje bygninger i klassisk kinesisk stil, hvorfra man kunne kigge ud over den park de laa i. Det saa noget underligt ud at der midt i en by af gamle boligblokke pludselig er en park med to klassiske kinesiske Pagodaer, flot udskykket med farver og diverse klokker og guldting. Men parken med soeen var et hyggeligt sted at gaa rundt uden biler og diverse saelgere. Dem moedte vi til gengaeld, da vi paa vores vej tilbage til hostellet gik paa Guilins hovedgade og de smaa sidegade, som er fyldt med smaa boder, hvorfra der bliver solgt de mest ubrugelige ting. -Men det hele er 'very cheap' og 'good price for you' i en uendelighed. Af og til kan man more sig med at stoppe op, kigge paa noget, saa saelgeren febrilsk proever at finde den ting man kigger paa - men peg for guds skyld aldrig paa noget, saa foelger han dig gerne 100 meter ned ad gaden, men prisen uden man har spurgt bliver lavere og lavere. ;-)Vi gik tidligt i seng og noed det laekre vaerelse - sammenlignet med det forrige.17. juni.Vi stod tidligt op, da vi dagen i forvejen havde arrangeret en baadtur paa Li-floden. Lidt spaendte paa om der dukkede nogen op for at hente os, gik vi ned i hostellets reception og var klar kl. 7. Lyset var slukket og der laa en mand i en sofa og sov. Turen var booket gennem en mand vi havde moedt paa gaden - men vi havde jo faaet en haandskevet kvittering med nogle tegn paa, saa vi gik da ud fra der ville komme nogen at hente os. Utaalmodige ventede vi og det var nu 20 min siden vi skulle vaere hentet, men pludselig ankommer en mini-van, vi viste ham kvitteringen og blev lukket ind, saa nu var vi i hvert fald paa vej. Vi blev koert til en naertliggende by, hvorfra baadturen skulle begynde. Her blev vi anbragt paa en lille bambusbaad med en motor, som trak den lille skrue for enden af en lang kardan. Langsomt blev vi foert ned af floden, og noed stilheden og den skoenne natur med flotte bjerge paa begge sider. Efter nogle timer ankom vi til byen Yangzhou. Her gik vi lidt rundt, spiste noget frokost og fik lige set det lokale madmarked - hvor man bestemt kunne koebe alt 'spiseligt' (for os meget uspiseligt). Der var alt fra 'friske' groensager, til hoens og HUNDE! Stanken i koedafdelingen var forfaerdelig, der var blod, fisk og andet snask paa gulvet og vaeggene og dyrene laa stuvet sammen i smaa bure. Selvom vi forinden ikke gjorde det saa meget i koedretter, var det for alvor slut med koed i Kina nu! :-( Birna havde lige en taare i oejet, da vi forlod de ynkelige kaniner samt en blanding af braeksmag i munden - meget appetitligt. Vi nappede en bus tilbage til Guilin og dovnede den resten af dagen.18. juliFriske stod vi op tidligt og nappede bussen til Longsheng hvor vi pludselig blev gennet ud og ind i en minibus midt i et kryds, fordi vi havde sagt vi ville til Dazei (en lille landsby i bjergene). Vi ankom som planlagt og moedte et ungt kinesisk par hvor fyren kunne en del engelsk og hjalp os lidt rundt og begge fulgte os det foerste stykke af vores trek paa omkring 16-20km mellem Dazei og Ping an. Vi gik og vi gik -op af bakker, ned af bakker og det var sindssygt varmt og haardt med de mange stigninger og fald, men hvor var det bare det hele vaerd, for pludselig gaar man der i bjergene omringet af de smukkeste risterasser i lag, som de eneste mennesker man kan skimte i miles omkreds og der er velfortjente hvilepladser i form af baenke spredt rundt omkring... :) Ved 4tiden naaede vi vores destination Ping an, som er en lidt stoerre landsby end Dazei placeret midt i alt det groenne, smukke landskab. Vi fik indlogeret os paa det bedste hotel (havde vi laest) til omkring 80kr for et dobbeltvaerelse! Vi spiste lidt god mad paa en af de lokale restauranter og var ellers saa traette i ben og laar at vi bare noejedes med at betragte udsigten i stedet for at gaa mere rundt. Om aftenen blev det et vildt uvejr, regnen piskede saa hardt ind paa vinduerne at vi var bange for de ikke holdt og gardinerne blafrede indenfor, mens vi saa en krimi i fjernsynet - en af de eneste steder vi havde fundet noget tv paa engelsk... Det var en hyggelig aften og vinduerne holdt heldigvis...19. juliVi skulle denne dag tilbage til Guilin, for at tage et tog videre til Nanning - vores springbraet til Vietnam. Vi soergede for i god tid at gaa mod pladsen, hvorfra busserne gik. Det havde dog vaeret lidt svaert at finde ud af hvad tid 'i god tid' var, for vi havde forhoert os paa hotellet og i en restuarant, hvad tid bussen gik og fik 5-6 forskellige svar, men vidste at der kun var een bus fra morgenstunden. Men vi kom ned til bussen og den afgik umiddelbart efter. Da vi ankom til Guilin havde vi lige tid til lidt mad og hentede vores rygsaekke, som vi havde faaet opbevaret paa hotellet vi tidligere havde boet paa, og saa gik turen mod togstationen. De saakaldte 'security check' paa togstationerne er blevet ren rutine. Taskerne skal scannes og Birna smider sig paa ryggen og koerer ind gennem scanneren - ej, den gaar ikke, men det virkelig noget af et maseri hver gang at skulle have de store rygsaekke af, for at en uopmaerksom naesepillende mand hurtigt kaster et blik paa skaermen, og taskerne igen skal paa ryggen. :-)Paa vores togture faldt vi ofte i snak - og denne tur var ingen undtagelse. Vi kom over mange emner lige fra ALLE kineseres had til japanere, blokering af Internettet - f.eks. Facebook - og hvorfor kinesere stirrer saa meget paa 'de hvide', selvom der efterhaanden er ret mange turister. Mange kinesere synes de blaa oejne og den hvide hud er smuk - derfor ses det ogsaa i mange kontaktannoncer, at kinesiske piger soeger 'Western looking man', og Mikkel fik ogsaa en del komplimenter af de noget generte piger - isaar den klassiske 'tall and handsome' er meget brugt! :-)Vi ankom lidt sent til Nanning og skulle have fat i nogle busbilletter til Hanoi. Vi havde spurgt paa hotellet og havde faaet peget en retning. Vi fandt et sted med store engelske skilte foran, som reklamerede med billetter. Vi gik derind og blev bag disken moedt af en kinesisktalende kvinde - og hun talte KUN kinesisk. Til trods for flere spoergsmaal paa engelsk blev hun ved med at 'svare' paa kinesisk, saa vi slog bare over i dansk. Frustrede over ikke at kunne faa noget information om, hvor vi kunne koebe billetterne forlod vi stedet. Heldigvis henviste Lonely Planet til et sted taet paa vores hotel, og fik endelig koebt nogle billetter til dagen efter. Det var blevet sent saa vi koebte noget hurtigt mad og tog tilbage til hotellet.20. juliDagen stod paa transport. Vi stod tidligt op, og gik mod busstationen, hvorfra vi begyndte den 7 timer lange bustur. Undervejs skulle vi af en gang, for at faa stemplet pas paa det kinesiske immigrationskontor for saa at blive koert i golfbiler over ingenmandsland, og saa ind paa det Vietnamesiske immigrationskontor. Saa tilbage i bussen for at koere de sidste 160 km. til Hanoi."
The last time I wrote a story I was in Guilin. I didn't have that much time to explain what I did over there and the internet was also not that fast so this time I will write a little bit more about that trip. Last time I already explained a bit so I will not explain everything anymore.We arrived in Guilin on Thursday evening and it was raining very bad. It stayed like that until Saturday afternoon. On Friday we went to the rice field with a tour bus. At th...
"So, another few days gone by and we are now in Gulin, having arrived a couple of hours ago on the 12 hour sleep train from Guangzhou...Unfortunately a lovely chinese man snoring and snoorting heavily in his sleep the bunk below me meant that I got a grand total of about an hour's sleep last night though, so bear with me if this blog's a little bit clunky...So, Hong Kong Disneyland, what can I say?!We had an awesome time, met the whole gang (all the princesses, Mickey, Minnie, Goofy AND Winnie the Pooh), went on classic rides such as It's a small world (which, despite everyone else in the world apparently loathing it, I actually love), the Mad Hatter's Teacups as well as an awesome Buzz Lightyear shoot 'em up ride, AND I even got to go on Space Mountain (AMAZING), it was all going so well until of course the rain hit... and it hit real hard!Of course neither of us had thought to bring a coat as we didn't think the ominous clouds over Lantau Island where the theme park is based would actually be filled with rain,duh!After quite a miserable time of it on the Autopia car ride, and a good half hour listening to the thunder and eating over priced ice cream at one of the fast food joints, we decided to cut our losses and headed back to Kowloon. It seems that every time we try to do something fun and not culturally related we get rained on, I think the big man upstairs is trying to tell us something!! Anyway, we grabbed some yummy noddly broth in a little restaurant near our hotel, and after much stressful and unsuccessful calling of guest houses in Macau to try and book accommodation for the Friday night so we could have one night living it up in the Las Vegas of Asia, we also made the decision to by-pass Macau and stay an additional night in the big smoke. Weirdly enough, in amongst the crappy tv movies on the only english movie channel on our tv, the film The Reader was on, so I settled in with the good but rather depressing holocaust film while Jade headed off for a late night skype chat with her family.Next day, Thursday, we took advantage of the break in the humidity because of the previous day's thunderstorm and headed off to Lantau Island again on the metro to see the Big Buddha there, which I think is the world's largest bronze outdoor sitting Buddha or some such size related world record as that, hence the big Buddha knickname (it's called something else but can't quite recall it right now!). We got the Ngong Ping 360 cable car up the mountainous terrain to the Buddha, pretty impressive considering both of us aren't great with heights as the thought of being suspended by a cable in what is essentially a glass case over the sea is terrifying to me!We made it safely to the top though, and got to see some stunning views of Hong Kong island in the distance and the South China Sea ( I think?!), and just about made the 260 step climb to the top of the big guy, who was indeed very very big, and very impressive!There was a lot of low lying cloud, but we were still able to check out the view from the top, and catch our breath before climbing back down all those steps again.I'm defnitely a lot fitter than when I left home what with carrying all my wordly possessions on my back and the million miles we walk a day on average, but I'm sure all the steps here in China wll be the death of me! After finding some 'Macaunese' food at a nearby shoppng mall food court (I could of sworn my beef and fried noodle combo was more chinese than Macaunese!), we headed back to the visa office in wan chai on Hong Kong Island, where we picked up our precious little passes back into China, then we made the very sweaty uphill clmb to Hong Kong park as we had read in our books about the Admirality Tea Museum running tea making classes every Thursday and friday at 4 and 5pm, and wanted to join in the fun. We arried at the museum just before 5, only to discover that the book had got the days and the times wrong, in fact they only run classes on something like Tuesday and Wednesdays and only at 4pm for an hour. Suffice to say, I don't recommend lonely planet China to anyone, as this is I think the second or third time they've got information like this wrong AND they're snooty about all the things that we've done and really enjoyed, like the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel, which is a kitschy but cool classic!Anway, rant over... we just decided to chill out in the park for a little bit after that, watching the world go by and the coy n the fish pond. Afterwards, we headed to the nearby Soho area of the island for some food, and settled on a little mexican place where I chowed down on a yummy chicken burrito and a well earned beer after all the steps and slopes of the day! The place we ate at was so busy that we ended up perching on a little table by the window, which was actually really cool as we were facing right on to the mid levels escalator and the stairs down from the top so we were able to do lots of good people watching. Hong Kong is such a vibrant and multi-cultural place, it's really cool to see lots of different nationalities represented, and it's particularly apparent in Soho where you can eat foods ranging from Russian to Lebanese!On our last day in Hong Kong, we got up early and grabbed a delcious and cheap breakfast at the McCafe (McDonald's in house version of starbucks, they're obviously trying to appeal to the yummy mummies who bring their screaming kids in for happy meals but wouldn't touch a big mac with a barge pole themselves!), booked our bus to Guangzhou then headed off on the metro to the nearby Flower and Bird markets at Prince Edward. The Flowers were just beautiful, loads of gorgeous lillies, roses, orchids and tulips as well as more exotic vareties. We saw some stunnng flower arrangements too, such a shame we couldn't buy any but life on the road means that flowers aren't such a practical choice for a gift to yourself!!The bird marke as cool too, although it did smell of, well, bird poo..loads of birds ranging from the teeny tiny to massive parrots and cockatoos, as well as live maggots and locust for sale for feedng to them, yeuck!! We had an interesting lunch at a place that was japanese for the most part, but also had japanese-italian fusion dishes too.. you wouldn't think that would work but jade's carbonara japanese style was definitely well received! just stuck to beef noodles in a spicy coconuty soup, it was really good. We caught our bus at half past four, and waved goodbye to Hong Kong. I really loved it, I think possible it's my favourite place in China that we've been to so far, though I do love Shanghai and Beijing too. I'd defnitely go back, especially once I've made my millions so I can hit the fabulous designer flagship stores and boutiques that line the streets. We had a bit of a stressful experience when we were going through immigration on the Chinese bit of the border, as we just assumed that we would had to get off the bus and get our documents and passport checked as we'd done a few minutes before when we officially left HK, but in actual fact we were changing buses but no one had told us this in English as all the other passengers on the bus where chinese, so unbeknownst to us after we'd got off the bus and nto the building, our bags had been unloaded and we were supposed to take them with us and put them through the scanner, before loading them onto the new bus at the other end. When someone did come to tell us, we'd already had our chinese visas stamped, so we had to have one of the border people escort us the couple of metres to our bags and back to the gate again, arrghhh!!!At least the bus didn't leave without us, small mercies!!We arrived in Guangzhou about half 8 on Friday evening, and we really didn't do much for the two days we were there until yesterday evening apart from a quick jaunt in the park and a go round the boating lake in a pedalo, as apart from some revolutionary sights (which we didn't really have the energy or the interest for), it's a pretty grim city very big and polluted. The one redeeming feature though, without a doubt is the food, as Guangzhou is probably better known as Canton, and the epicurean centre of cantonese food!!n particular, we had a delicious meal on Saturday probably the best chinese food we've ever had actually, in the very fancy Panx restaurant, which had shark fin soup going for the equivalent of about 88 quid, and some very interesting offal dishes... We haven't lost our senses or our money though, as we stuck to the more suitably priced dim sum menu, and or the equivalent of about 6 pounds each, we feasted on flavoursome chicken sprng rolls, shrimp dumplings, and-my favourite-steamed pork buns, which is bascally barbequed pork in a kind of chutney all wrapped up in sweet, fluffy bread. They sound disgusting but are really delicious, I would definitely recommend them!It was quite funny when we went to the restaurant though, as we got caught in another torrential downpour, and although this time we did have our pac-a-macs (well, I had my massive and obviously extremely fashionable floral poncho), we still got pretty much soaked to the skin, and so when we got to the restaurant we walked in lookng like little drowned rats and quietly taking our seats, while the waitresses looked on bemused and pretty much the entire restaurant turned, stared and (some people) laughed at us...oh dear!!Anyway, as I said, we've just arrived in Guilin now, and after a pretty restless night's journey I'm off to get a shower to blow the cobwebs away. More soon.lots of love from Guilin xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
"Kaere Nina og Katrina,Foerst og fremmest: Tak for sidst, det var nogle rigtig gode dage vi havde i Sapa. Jeg glaeder mig virkelig til at tage paa Roskilde med jer!Saa kom vi alle tre til Kina - bare forskellige steder. Jeg befinder mig i Guilin, som ligger i provinsen Guangxi og I er sandsynligvis stadig i Yunnan - maaske i provinshovedstaden Kunming? Nu har vi moedtes i baade Cambodia og Vietnam og hvem ved - maaske render vi ogsaa ind i hinanden her i Kina. I Shanghai, maaske?Foer jeg slipper Vietnam helt og tager hul paa mine foerste Kina-indtryk, har jeg saadan lyst til at fortaelle lidt om en af de oplevelser, der gjorde stoerst indtryk paa mig i Vietnam:Jeg tog paa en dagsudflugt til Den Demilitariserede Zone nord for Hue for et par uger siden. Mit hostel i Hue arrangerede det saadan, at jeg kunne tage paa DMZ-tur og saa blive sat af i en by lidt nord for DMZ (kan ikke huske hvad byen hedder, lad og bare kalde den X.) En natbus fra Hue til Hanoi ville saa samle mig op i denne by. Receptionisten paa mit hostel i Hue sagde, at jeg bare kunne give bagagen til hende, saa ville hun soerge for, at det kom paa bussen. Jeg tog det helt for givet, at hun ville aflevere bagagen til den bus, som jeg skulle paa DMZ-tur med. Den afgik lige uden for hostlet. Det gjorde hun imidlertid ikke. Desvaerre opdagede jeg foerst det, da jeg steg af DMZ-tur-bussen i byen X og kiggede i dennes bagagerum. Jeg blev temmelig forskraekket, for hvor var al min bagage nu henne? Chauffoeren paa bussen kunne ikke fortaelle mig det, og han kunne kun pege hen paa det sted, hvor min naeste bus skulle afhente mig. Heldigvis steg en ung vietnamesisk pige og sin far af bussen samtidig med mig. De skulle overnatte i X foer de skulle videre. Denne unge vietnamesiske pige saa starks, at jeg var traet, irriteret og ikke vidste, hvor min bagage var. Hun fulgte mig straks hen paa det kontor, hvor jeg skulle vente paa min naeste bus. Receptionisten paa dette rejse-kontor talte ikke ret meget engelsk, saa min vietnamesiske veninde satte hende ind i situationen. Receptionisten anede ikke hvor min bagage var henne - og hun havde heller ikke umiddelbart taenkt sig at goere en indsats for at finde ud af det. Det ville jeg saa selv goere, men min vietnamesiske veninde bad om min telefon, og saa ringede hun til mit hostel i Hue. De kunne ikke umiddelbart fortaelle  min bagage befandt sig. De bad os ringe tilbage lidt efter. Det gjorde min vietnamesiske veninde saa. Nu var de kommet frem til, at de havde afleveret min bagage til det busselskab, som skulle afhente mig i byen X senere paa aftenen. Alt imens alt dette ringen stod paa, havde pigens far koebt coaer til os alle sammen, saa jeg fik pulsen lidt ned med lidt koldt at drikke. Min vietnamesiske veninde ville straks ringe til busselskabet for at hoere, om de havde modtaget min bagage, men jeg stolede paa, at den ville vaere med bussen der hentede mig senere paa aftenen. Jeg synes allerede hun havde hjulpet mig en masse. I stedet for bare at sige farvel og skynde sig vaek, tilboed hun mig at tage en lur paa hendes seng i det hotel, hende og hendes far havde lejet for natten. Jeg havde mere lyst til at gaa ud og finde noget at spise, og boed hende paa kaffe i stedet. Hun lo bare og sagde, at jeg da ikke skulle koebe kaffe til hende, hun haabede bare, at jeg fandt min taske.Senere den aften steg jeg paa bussen til Hanoi og droemte maerkelige droemme. Da jeg efter en elendig nats soevn ankom til Hanoi og kiggede i bussen bagagerum var min bagage der gud hjaelpe mig ikke. Igen var buschauffoeren ikke til megen hjaelp, men det var derimod en anden ung vietnamesisk kvinde. Hun kunne straks se, at jeg var sur og forvirret, og spurgte hvad der var galt. Jeg forklarede hende situationen og mens jeg steg paa bussen igen og ringede til mit hostel i Hue blev hun hos mig. Hostlet i Hue sagde, at min bagage ville ankomme med bus til et eller andet kontor i Hanoi senere paa dagen. Det kunne jeg jo paa ingen maade vaere tilfreds med, for jeg ville ikke bruge energi paa at tage til tilfaeldige kontorer i Hanoi fordi de ikke kunne saette min bagage paa den rigtige bus. Jeg fik dem overtalt til at bringe min bagage til det hostel i Hanoi, hvor jeg have taenkt mig at vaere. da det endelig virkede til at ordne sig sagde den unge vietnamesiske kvinde farvel, og gik ud af bussen, der ikke havde flyttet sig mens jeg talte i telefon. Et oejeblik efter kom hun igen med en seddel med sit navn paa og et telefonnummer; ""du ringer bare, hvis du har brug for hjaelp, jeg skal nok hjaelpe,"" sagde hun. Jeg fortalte hende, at jeg ville tage en taxi til mit nye hostel og hun hjalp mig med at preje en.Senere den eftermiddag fik jeg min bagage. Pointen med denne lange, kedsommelige historie er, at disse unge kvinder uopfordret brugte en masse tid paa at hjaelpe mig. De kunne se, at jeg ikke var glad, og de reagerede straks paa det. De viste mig omsorg og beroligede mig og sagde, at min bagage nok skulle dukke op. Det havde vaeret saa let for dem bare at sige ""naa, det var da synd for dig, haaber du finder din bagage"", men i stedet valgte de at goere en indsats for at hjaelpe mig. Jeg havde jo fundet bagagen uden deres hjaelp, men deres opbakning gjorde faktisk det, at miste sin bagage til en roerende og inspirerende oplevelse - i hvert fald da foerst den var i hus igen :)Naa, jeg vil smutte ud og faa noget at spise. Det flere dage siden jeg har faaet ris - det maa vi hellere goere noget ved.Nyd nu Kina rigtig meget!Kaerlige hilsner Henriette"
"Today was a fairly short walk downhill from Ping'an where we caught a bus back to Guilin.  We got back to Guilin and had 6 hours to kill before we could pick up our bags from the train station where we had left them a couple of days before catching the overnight train to Hong Kong.Most of us headed to the nearest internet cafe as this would pass some time.  While here I checked Intrepid’s website and also the Foreign Office website to see what the situation in Bangkok had got like.  Intrepid said that the trips were going on as planned and the Foreign Office was advising that people reconsider their travel plans.  I still had a few days to decide what to do, but I would probably go anyway.After surfing for a while, Craig & Jess and I went off for a walk in Guilin and in a few camera and electrical shops to pass the time.  We bumped into Tom & Sarah along our way, while they were heading back.Another couple of hours passed and the 3 of us went for some dinner before meeting up with the group at the luggage lockers at 8pm.  We collected out bags, headed over to the waiting room and boarded our 16 hour hard sleeper train to Shenzhen, at the China / Hong Kong border."
"Very, very many thanks to everyone for their kind birthday wishes, they are very much appreciated!Well, it's Labour Day today in The People's Republic, so we are all having 4 days holiday! I've taken myself off to Guilin to stay in a nice hotel and explore the surroundings. Bianca, my erstwhile fellow volunteer, had no such plans but found herself the only person remaining in the school with no food and someone's alarm clock going off in the room next door, so ..."
"I'd already written this blog and it disappeared on me so here goes again.....We arrived in Guilin after a horrendous overnight train journey and after having had little or no sleep on the Yangtze River Cruise for 3 nights. Needless to say we were both ill!! Decided that we deserved a day in our bed so we checked into our hostel and vegged out for the rest of the day - it was bliss!!Feeling refreshed and revived the next day, we headed to the Seven Stars Park which is the central, focal point of Guilin and is huge! The weather was stunning so we spent most of the day wandering through the various routes and hill treks getting ourselves lost and enjoying it! Also, in the park there were wild monkeys roaming about without a care in the world, it was pretty awesome!Other highlights of our stay in Guilin included a day at the famous Dragon Rice Terraces and a bamboo raft down the Li River. The tour to the rice terraces was amazing and included a stop at the Long Haired village to see how the traditional tribes live and thrive which was fascinating. From there our kamakaze bus driver haired it up the hill where we trekked to the top to look out over the terraces. The view was out of this world and definitely worth the trip.The bamboo raft down the Li River is a must for anyone in Guilin, as this is one of the most famous scenic spots in China. The scene has even made it's way onto the back of the twenty yuan note! We had a lovely day just lazing back, taking in the sights and the sunshine.The only down point was that our hostel was a bit rubbish, so anyone heading to Guilin, I wouldn't recommend the Backstreet Hostel. The rooms were good and a fair size but there was no atmosphere and the staff were unhelpful.Getting the overnight bus (!) from here to Shenzen which will no doubt be an experience! Blog soon!! xx"
"Hey everyone!Today we went to the most depressing Zoo in the world! There were pandas but they were not happy pandas. Also there were Kangaroos and Lemurs and dancing Bears but it was just sad how awfull it all was! The enclosures were small and dirty even for animals, and there were no people at all looking after the animals or checking on them.Yesterday we went to the Longji Rice Terraces, and Longsheng village up in the mountains. It was the highlight of o..."
"I packed my trunk, and said goodbye to the circus!!!A few more fairwells have been said since my last blog, and Matt and I were on our way to Guilin. Sunday was complete waste of the day, we spent it traveling, and by the time we arrived in our destination we were to tired and headed straight to bed for a busy day next day. Scott arrived early on the Monday morning and we set off for Elephant Trunk hill. First impressions of Guilin was that it was much more touristy than Changsha, however seemed to have kept the rural chinese feel that you don't get in big cities. The hill was ok, not worth the money though - since apparently Guilin doesn't do student discounts. A short river cruise was then partaken in, no sickness (river li is very flat) in which we headed north up the river, to see some spectacular mountain ranges.Tuesday was an early start, as we went on an other river cruise to Yangshuo, a small farming town south of Guilin. The two hour cruise on a traditional styled boat was pleasant and well worth doing, except our boat broke down and we just drifted for a time, until he could get the motor started again. Once there we hired some bikes - believe it, Karen riding a bike!! and cycled to a giant tree, which is over 1400 years old (apparently) also went on a bamboo raft which we got to steer and power, much more difficult than it looks. If you ever go to Yangshou you must eat beer fish, specialty for the area, and worth the money. Bus back to hostel and early night had by the three of us.The tiger and bear mountain village - our destination for wednesday. I read online that they feed live cows and bulls to packs of tigers, which may sound disguisting to watch, however it is advertised as ""allowing the tigers to maintain their natural instincts"" The boys really wanted to see this . . . I was indifferent, part of me really wanted to see it, whilst I also felt sickened by the thought. But of we went in search of some mauling. There are other things to see there to, first stop was an arena with performing tigers. They had them jump through burning hoops, ride on a horses back, roll over - can't even get cookie to do that, let alone an animal that could eat me. Next was the bears, which were doing summersaults on a pole, and walking like humans. You know when you really don't like something, and the feeling of sickness in squirming in the pit of your stomach. That doesn't even begin to describe the feeling that I had when sitting there. But the show was almost hypnotic, you couldn't look away. If animals had the ability to feel humilated, then they definitely would have for this show, I felt it for them. We also saw the bears doing walking handstands and riding bikes, and a goat walk over a tight rope, all of which were just as bad the previously seen acts. So the thing we came for, the killing of a bull . . . the only ""natural"" thing that exsists in this park - cause clearly the rest was not natural instinct.CANCELLED!!!! - we paid 80yuan basically just to watch a circus act, waste of time and money, i'll know for next time.I then went to Seven Star park, without Matt and Scott. The only thing that I wanted to see when coming to Guilin was the cave that is within this park. It is a big tourist attraction, meaning big prices to get in. The park entrance was resonable, and worth it, lovely park with nice temples and great hills and views. The cave, 60yuan was steep, but really nice inside, shame the guide was in chinese, could have got much more from it if I understood what was going on. Also in the park was Rob and Thore, two guys that were in Beijing with me, so that was nice - meeting them. The five of us went out for dinner and few drinks before Matt and I boarded our train to Sanya. We can't get direct train there, and so we are now randomly in a small rundown village place very far south of China, awaiting the next train. Until next time"
"We are in Guilin!!!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone!!!! This has been an awesome (yes, truly AWESOME) trip! We took the school bus from Luxu to Suzhou, then took a train from Suzhou to Huang Shan (Yellow Mountain). Then from Huang Shan, we drove to Hanzhou and took a plane to Guilin. We spent a day travelling around Yangshuo, and then back to Guilin. Our tour is over, and we liked Yangshuo so much, we are heading back there today. I am currently s..."
"It was quite a trip and we arrived after dark. Feeling hungry Ad grabbed a parcel covered in banana leaf as a snack. It contained rice and beans, was ok a bit salty for my liking. Got a cab to the Breakfast Backpackers hostel and managed to get in a dorm room for the night. A nice chilled out place with many tourists lounging in the cafÃ© area in front of reception. We dumped our bags and headed out to the town. Straight away a local guy got talking to us, he was very nice but our chatting led us to his art gallery. It was very nice and he had some beautiful paintings. Obviously we wasn't going to buy, where would we put them, but thanked him for his time and showing us around and headed off. Found some shops - very much like home, Ad was looking for a new day bag as his kept ripping, I've sewn it a number of times, he found some possible keepers but not sure.Found a cheap place for dinner where we had a huge noodle soup, very filling and tasty, reminded me of eating in Japan, brought back good memories. Then took a stroll around the lake, capturing many pictures of the sun and moon pagoda's all lit up at night, very pretty. The whole walk way was done up nice, lit up in many colored lights, so cute. Lights went out about 10:30, so we headed back. Bit of web, watched rest of Liar Liar and then sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.9:10am start - 3rd time running, think that's our brain alarm clock setting at the mo. Woke up the other person in our room from our rustling WHOPPS! Found a nice place in town to share a fried noodle and fried rice, not the best brekky in the world, but suited us just fine, it tasted very nice and was delicious so all good. Now just had to check out of hostel and book our bus, which doesn't leave until tonight, so we have a whole day here. The tours seem too expensive for what they are, so we decided to just stick to the area.Got talking to an English couple who were just off to see the local cave, but at Â£9 a person, we wasn't that bothered about it. Went for a look around another section of town. After 4.5 days of no cakes and chocolate, I slipped and we ventured into a cake shop. Ad got a pizza looking slice and I got what I thought was a cheesecake topped with coconut sprinkles - it turned out to be all cream, but hey ho tasted good all the same. So naughty we even picked up cookies for our trip tonight tut tut.Looked around the shops some more, Ad still never found a day bag he liked. Came across a stationery shop and managed to find a really nice diary, which Ad is going to put away for me for Christmas YEHH, I love diaries, unfortunately there was nothing suitable for Ad. On way back to hostel we saw a sweet shop, which was like torture, it had all the good stuff from home, but was way too expensive, I couldn't just gwalk passed could I, nope I had to go in and have a look, luckily Ad managed to drag me back out again.He'd been looking at lots of images in a kinda travel diary he found in the stationery shop and this gave him inspiration to focus a bit more on the photos he was taking. This meant that his normal 30mins of taking a picture - now became an hour, oh yes we stopped every few seconds so he could get that arty farty pic he's been wanting to get zzzzzzzzzz.Sat around waiting for bus, got chatting to the English couple again and they said we didn't miss much at the caves, so that's good. A really sweet lady who originally comes from Indonesia came to get us, she was so cute, reminded us of a little umper lumper, she got us to follow her, there was us thinking the bus would be just around the corner, but nope she got us to follow her onto a local bus, which she paid for and she got off with us at the bus station and walked us right over to our night bus. Talk about top service.The bus looked like a party bus, lights all over it and blacked out windows, it's been pimped. It was just as impressive on the inside, even better than the last one we went on, with it's shiny wooden floors and neat interior - NICE!! We were more than happy to take our shoes off and place them into plastic bags. The covers were so soft and had cute pic's of puppies on them arrrhhh so sweet. Ad's body was slightly too long for his bed, so we swapped, for some reason my nice spot near the window had more leg room, it was only fair. Had trouble sleeping at first and although I finally got to sleep, I did keep waking up, think I was just a bit hot. Better than sitting all the way though, so can't complain."
"Kina! Hvordan skal man dog beskrive dette land... Sidder lige nu i toget pÃ¥ vej mod Guilin og spekulerer over det...!? Det er torsdag og kl. er 12! Vi startede vores togtur i gÃ¥r kl.23.30, 2Â½ time forsinket... Og en tur pÃ¥ 20 timer ialt.Vi faldt i sÃ¸vn meget kort tid efter vi var kommet i vores senge,som denne gang var pÃ¥ 1.klasse! Ja hold da op hvad lavede backpackerne da lige der... Men da der pÃ¥ denne togrejse ikke var den store forskel i prisen, besluttede vi os for at prÃ¸ve 1.klasse. Ellers har vi jo ikke noget at sammenligne med, hvis ikke vi har prÃ¸vet begge dele. Vi kan lave den konklusion, at der er stor forskel i astmofÃ¦ren og folkene. Der er pÃ¥ 2.klasse meget mere god stemning og man har mulighed for at ""snakke"" med de lokale. Det er der slet ikke noget af det pÃ¥ denne her tur. Det er pÃ¦ne mennesker, sÃ¥ der er ro og orden. SelvfÃ¸lgelig er sengene en tand bedre, da der er mere plads, grundet at der kun er 4 i en vogn, frem for 6 pÃ¥ 2.klasse... SÃ¥ vi fÃ¥r bestemt ikke de samme gode oplevelser at grine af, som de 2 andre togrejser vi har vÃ¦ret pÃ¥. Men sÃ¥ er det prÃ¸vet...Men tilbage til Kina... Vi var jo blevet fortalt sÃ¥ meget fra folk som selv havde vÃ¦ret i kina. Meget forskellige oplevelser, hvordan folk havde oplevet landet. Men vi skulle jo selv opleve og finde ud af hvad vi synes. Vi har snakket meget om det, og sammenlignet med andre asiatiske lande vi har vÃ¦ret i. Det er absolut et land for sig selv! Kineserne er noget helt for dem selv! Men samtidig meget forskellige fra by til by. F.eks. i Beijing er byen jo nÃ¦rmest klinisk ren. I metroen bliver der gjort rent konstant, sÃ¥ der hele tiden er pÃ¦nt. Tror ikke at kÃ¸benhavnsmetro kan prale af det samme.Der render kommunefolk rundt alle vejne og samler affald op, der er folk som sÃ¸rger for at trafikken sÃ¥dan nogenlunde bliver overholdt og det er forbudt at spytte pÃ¥ gaden. Hvilket som er noget kineserne gÃ¸r i STOR stil!!! Men vi sÃ¥ ikke noget til deres dÃ¥rlige manÃ©r (set med danske Ã¸jne) med spytteri, hakken og prutten der! Videre til XiÂ´an var det heller ikke sÃ¥ slemt, men der sÃ¥ vi lidtmere slum, men ikke noget vildt. Det var fÃ¸rst da vi nÃ¥ede til Chongqing, hvor vi kommer fra nu, at vi sÃ¥ den helt store forskel! Denne by bar meget prÃ¦g af slum, dÃ¥rlig manÃ©r (igen set fra vores synspunkt) og som pÃ¥ dansk ville kaldes ""dÃ¥rlig opdragelse"" !!! De hakkede og spyttede alle vejne! Spiste rigtig grimt og svinede. Der blev bare smidt affald pÃ¥ gaden ud fra vinduerne. Som en dag vi kom gÃ¥ende, kom der pludselig en affaldspose flyvende ned fra 30.sal! vi snakkede med vores ""ven""(ung kineser) fra det hostel vi boede pÃ¥. Han sagde at det primÃ¦rt var de gamle der havde dÃ¥rlige manÃ©r. Han synes ikke at de unge var sÃ¥dan. Han beskrev den Ã¦ldre generation, som folk der ikke sagde undskyld og spyttede og pruttede pÃ¥ gaden uden hÃ¦mninger.Vi havde ""hyrret"" ham til at vise os rundt i byen om formiddagen, da vi besluttede ikke at tage pÃ¥ cruise pÃ¥ Yangtze floden (som planlagt), sÃ¥ der fik vi os nogle meget interessante snakke, som sÃ¥ fortsatte om aftenen, da vi ikke orkede andet end at vÃ¦re pÃ¥ hostel, sÃ¥ der sad vi hele aftenen og snakkede med ham i receptionen. Han er den fÃ¸rste vi mÃ¸der som mestrede det engelske sprog rigtig flot! Det var vildt interessant at hÃ¸re ham fortÃ¦lle om kineserne og samfundet. HÃ¸rer hans meninger og se hans ansitsudtryk nÃ¥r vi fortalte hvordan systemet fungerede i Danmark! Han var f.eks. dybt rystet over at vores regering sad i kun 4 Ã¥r, hvor sÃ¥ befolkningen kunne stemme dem ud, og vÃ¦lge nogle andre til at reagere! Det er slet ikke en mulighed i Kina! Og hvordan det er muligt i danske aviser at komme med sin mening og holdning til f.eks.regeringen. Det er slet ikke en mulighed i Kina. Han havde aldrig hÃ¸rt om folk der skrev noget dÃ¥rligt i avisen om regeringen.......Facebook er jo lukket, efter uroligheder i sommer, hvor en del af landet ville vÃ¦re selvstÃ¦ndige. 6 mennesker blev drÃ¦bt, af regeringen, og urolighederne stoppede til sidst, da der intet var at gÃ¸re mod regeringen. Vores ""ven"" fortalte, at hvis man forsÃ¸gte at finde noget om det pÃ¥ nettet, var det umuligt, da alt var slettet fra regeringens side! Og facebook blev lukket sÃ¥ der slap sÃ¥ lidt information ud til omverdenen som muligt. Det er endnu ikke Ã¥bnet, og det synes han var lidt irriterende, men det var ikke sÃ¥dan, at han var oprÃ¸rt over det. SÃ¥dan var det jo bare! Vi fortalte ham, at det aldrig ville kunne ske i Danmark. Hvis det skete, ville der vÃ¦re mange demonstrationer. Det sÃ¥ han slet ikke som en mulighed, for der var ikke noget at gÃ¸re. Regeringen bestemmer, har altid gjort det, og hvis du siger den imod, kan du miste livet!Den nuvÃ¦rende regering har vel siddet over 60 Ã¥r, hvor der ingen mulighed er for at skifte den ud, og det er accepteret af den stÃ¸rste del af befolkningen, tror jeg... Det er vel stadig MaoÂ´s tanker der kÃ¸rer videre, med lidt justeringer selvfÃ¸lgelig. MÃ¦rkeligt at der er sÃ¥ mange der besÃ¸ger hans maosuleum pÃ¥ den ""himmelskefredsplads"" i Beijing. Det er flere millioner om Ã¥ret, mÃ¥ske milliarder. Han er Ã©n af de stÃ¸rste massemordere i verden. Da han kom til magten i 40Â´erne (efter han stiftede det kommunistiskte parti og fik Ã¦ren for at fÃ¥ japanerne ud af Kina under krigen), dÃ¸dede miliioner af mennesker. Fordi han eksportede fÃ¸devare til udlandet, tjente penge pÃ¥ det og lod sin egen befolkning sulte. Og den dag i dag hÃ¦nger han som en helt pÃ¥ den ""himmelske fredsplds""! Hvor er det grutesk. Men okay han fik japanerne ud af landet (efter hvad jeg kan lÃ¦se mig frem til i ""Vilde svaner"". Men efterfÃ¸lgende reagerede han pÃ¥ hÃ¸jde med Hitler. En ung gut vi snakkede med i XiÂ´an, sagde at de unge bestemt ikke sÃ¥ ham som en helt, tvÃ¦rtimod. Det forstÃ¥r man sÃ¥ godt, da mange af hans kommunistiske tanker kÃ¸rer videre...Vi havde vÃ¦ret spÃ¦ndte pÃ¥, inden vi tog afsted, hvordan det ville vÃ¦re at rejse pÃ¥ egen hÃ¥nd rundt i et land, hvor stort set alle ikke taler engelsk! Det er selvfÃ¸lgelig lidt vanskeligere, nÃ¥r tegn ogg sprog er sÃ¥ meget forskelligt fra os,men det har pÃ¥ inet tidspunkt givet anledning til problemer. Vi har ikke haft problemer med at komme frem og tilbage, og de ansatte pÃ¥ vores hostel rundt omkring, har der vÃ¦ret en del som har mestret engelsk, sÃ¥ godt at de har kunne hjÃ¦lpe os. Som f.eks. at skrive togstationens navn pÃ¥ kinesisk, sÃ¥ taximanden vidste hvor vi skulle hen... en stor hjÃ¦lp! Eller nÃ¥r vi kommer til en ny by, altid have sÃ¸rget for at have adressen pÃ¥ kinesisk.For lige at slutte mine tanker af omkring Kina... sÃ¥ er vi begge enige om, at de er et specielt folkefÃ¦rd. Deres mad er ikke noget at rÃ¥be hurra for, og deres dÃ¥rlige manÃ©r (i nogle byer) ser vi ikke specielt tiltrÃ¦kkende. Deres kommunistiske styre er ogsÃ¥ bare sÃ¥ forskelligt fra det man er vant til og vokset op med, sÃ¥ det er sÃ¥ svÃ¦rt at forstÃ¥ ""hvorfor"". Men vi er begge enige om, at deres historie er ekstrem spÃ¦ndende, ogsÃ¥ bare det at den gÃ¥r 5000 Ã¥r tilbage. Alle deres historiske fund i landet, deres dynastier igennem tiderne og hele landets udvikling er vildt spÃ¦ndende. jeg har lÃ¦st rigtig meget pÃ¥ nettet og bÃ¸ger for at prÃ¸ve at gÃ¸re mig klog pÃ¥ bare en lille brÃ¸kdel af historien. Og hvor er det indvilket, men det gÃ¸r det sÃ¥ meget mere spÃ¦ndende:-) Jeg har sammenlignet dem en del med grÃ¸nlÃ¦nderne. Det er sgu ikke for sjov, at man kalder grÃ¸nlÃ¦nderne for ""iskinesere""! De har faktsik samme holdning og dÃ¥rlige manÃ©r med mange ting. Som deres holdning til at smide affald ud af vinduet ""jeg har ikke lige brug for det her fjernsyn mere, sÃ¥ det ryger sgu lige ud af vinduet"" SÃ¥ det sÃ¥ tit i Nuuk. Eller en madras som ikke skulle bruges mere, bare ud af vinduet med den... Og affaldsposer alle vegne.Plus deres spytteri! SÃ¥ en stor sammenligning :-)Vi har nydt vores tid i kina, fÃ¥et nogle fede oplevelser, og der har vÃ¦ret sÃ¥ mange ting vi gerne har villet se, som f.eks. blev vi vildt inspireret afTibet, og ville gerne have gjort et stop der, men tiden var ikk til det. Og det er ikke noget man mÃ¥ gÃ¸re uden en guide og visum, sÃ¥ det blev droppet. Og mange andre steder, som kunne have vÃ¦ret interessant at opleve. Men nu med snart 3 uger uden strand, glÃ¦der vi os meget til at komme til Filippinerne og nyde stranden, vandet og fÃ¥ andre madoplevelser! Jeg fandt havregryn i supermarkedet den anden dag, sÃ¥ har siden nÃ¦rmest levet af havregrÃ¸d! I dag bÃ¥de til morgenmad og frokost! Det er altid til at fÃ¥ kogt vand her i landet, sÃ¥ det er jo nemt. Kasper skulle sÃ¥ ikke nyde noget af min havregrÃ¸d, sÃ¥ nudlerne rÃ¸g ned igen igen igen igen...... Er sÃ¥ trÃ¦t af nudelsuppe og spyd med noget kÃ¸d pÃ¥, man ikke aner hvad er! egentlig utrolig vi ikke er blevet syge, af al den gademad vi har levet af! OgsÃ¥ kaspers sarte mave har tÃ¥lt det.... :-)Toget kÃ¸rer nu igennem bjerglandskaber, floder og rismarker i stor stil. Solen skinner udenfor og hvor vi dog glÃ¦der os til at komme ud og mÃ¦rke den. vi har ikke haft sol den sidste uges tid. I Emei regnede det og var ikke specielt varmt, i Chongqing regnede det ikke, men vi manglede solen! Men vi kommer jo mere og mere sydpÃ¥, sÃ¥ det skulle ogsÃ¥ meget gerne blive varmere! Vi har snakket om at leje et par cykler og nyde byen i Guilin i morgen. Vi har booket 2 overnatninger her, og sÃ¥ er planen at vi tager videre med bÃ¥d til Yangshuo, en by syd for Guilin med store risterrasser overalt. Der skal nok blive taget mange billeder af det fotografiske landskab!kan da lige til slut fortÃ¦lle at vi fik 2 timers massage i gÃ¥r. En rigtig god start pÃ¥ dagen, men vi havde samtidig ogsÃ¥ besluttet inden vi tog afsted, at vi ville prÃ¸ve noget kinesisk ""massage"". SÃ¥ efter den dejlige massage, bestilte vi en omgang smertefuldt 15 minutter! Ved ikke hvad det hedder pÃ¥ dansk (ved slet ikke om det udÃ¸ves i Dk), men man fÃ¥r sat glas pÃ¥ ryggen som suger sig fast! Det gjorde sindssygt ondt, og nu efterfÃ¸lgende er vi fuldt med kÃ¦mpe sugemÃ¦rker pÃ¥ hele ryggen! Kasper vÃ¥gnede mange gange af det i nat, nÃ¥r han skulle vende sig... Det gÃ¸r vi sÃ¥ nok ikke igen! Det siges at fjerne alle dÃ¥rligheder!Tak for jeres hilsner, bÃ¥de mail og pÃ¥ forum! Det betyder helt ubeskriveligt meget at hÃ¸re fra jer der hjemme!De kÃ¦rligste hilsner fra ""os2"""
"Efter at have vaeret vidt omkring Kina i byer vi ikke kendte paa forhaand, gik turen til Guilin som vi havde planlagt vi ville se.. Guilin var deevaerre en blandet oplevelse for os. Da vi tjekkede ind paa vores vaerelse opdagede Nanna at hendes ene trekkingsko var faldet af tasken, saa vi maatte ud at lede efter den. Vi gik ruten som vi havde gaaet tre timer inden, da byen stadig sov, men nu var der liv i gaden og de smaa fejekinesere var i gang og vi fandt ikke skoen! Aev aev, efter at have soerget lidt over skoen, tog vi med Linda ud for at se os lidt omkring i byen. Vi endte ved et shoppingsted og her blev der shoppet baade toej og sandaler og nogle soede ugletasker, som Nanna er blevet helt vilde med. Vi gik tilbage til hostellet og saa Ratatouille (eller hvordan filmen med rotten nu staves) Midt i filmen kom Charlotte (UK) som vi moedte i Xian ind paa hostellet og om aftenen tog vi paa nightmarket sammen. Paa vej derhen foelte Nanna pludselig at hendes taske blev lettere og inden hun naaede at taenke havde hun grebet fat i tyven, som saa hende lige i oejnene smed kameraet og gik saa ellers lidt vaek. Magnus raabte lidt af ham, tyven raabte lidt igen, og stilte sig saa ellers 2 meter vaek og ventede paa den naeste uvidende turist. Det var saa frustrende at han ikke loeb eller virkede bange eller at der ikke bare kom en lille reaktion. Han kiggede bare ligegyldigt paa os og vi vidste ikke hvad vi skulle goere. Vi blev alle enige om at der ikke rigtig var andet at goere end at ryste den ubehagelige oplevelse af os, for hvis vi gik til politiet ville de sikkert ikke forstaa os eller det ville vaere vores ord mod hans. Og hvis vi skulle beskrive ham ville det vaere lidt svaert for politiet at gaa efter ""en almindelig hoejde fyr i 40'erne med sort haar, lidt skaeve sorte oejne og en hvid skjorte med blaa aermer"" for hvor mange findes der ikke af den type her?? Vi gik hen til nightmarket osede lidt og holdte ellers godt fat i vores vaerdier!Naeste dag stod vi tidligt op, for vi skulle paa tur til nogle rismarker sammen med Linda, Charlotte og 3 drenge fra Sverige Anton, Bjoern og Alexander. Vi havde koebt turen gennem hostellet og havde regnet med at det ville vaere folk fra hostellet i en minibus, men nej. Vi blev sat paa en stor bus med en masse kinesere, efter en del venten koerte vi afsted imens vores guide fortalte om dagen. Han fortalte at vi skulle se 2 landsbyer og derefter rismarkerne og han lagde stor vaegt paa ""If you get lost you are on your own, we will NOT wait for you"" og han sluttede af med at sige ""You paid alot of money to go on this tour, so you must enjoy it, otherwise you wasted your money!"" Saa efter at vi havde faaet besked paa ikke at blive vaek og at vi skulle nyde turen skulle vi skifte bus til en mindre bus. Vi ventede laenge... Landsbyen som vi skulle se var kendte for at kvinderne ikke klipper deres haar, saa det er ca. 2 meter langt. Man kunne se et show, men vi takkede alle nej til at betale 60 yuan (ca. 50 kr) for at se dem danse og synge. Saa vi fik besked paa at vente udenfor i en time imens han sagde ""You will not be able to enjoy long hair outside, you will only be able to enjoy long hair inside"" Saa hoejdepunktet i showet ville vaere at damerne slog deres haar ud.. Det fik os nu ikke overbevist! Resten af dagen gik mest af alt med at vente paa de forskellige busser som skulle tage os op til rismarkerne. Da vi endelig naaede rismarkerne, til den tid hvor vi egentlig skulle have vaeret tilbage paa hostellet var vi godt utilfredse. Vi fik halvanden time til at naa op og ned.. Rismarker var flotte, men intet i forhold til de billeder paa reklamerne for turen. Saa da vi kom tilbage til hostellet 3 timer forsinket, efter at have vaeret afsted i 14 timer, var vi rigtig sure. Vi gik op til receptionen for at faa vores penge tilbage, og saa gik der ellers en times tid med diskussion frem og tilbage, der blevet ringet til det agency som havde arrangeret turen og manageren af hostellet op til flere gange, men det endte med at vi kun kunne faa 30 yaun ud af 150 tilbage. Vi endte tog det og gik i seng ret skuffede over dagens tur. Imens folk paa hostellet begyndte at afbestille deres tur dagen efter.Sidste dag tog de andre til Yangshou, hvor vi moedes med dem senere, og vi brugte dagen med at gaa rundt i byen. Nu glaeder vi os til at vi om lidt skal med bussen til Yangshou, en by som vi har glaedet os til at komme til siden Beijing. Jubii.. Nu haaber vi bare at vores held vender og vi kan faa det rigtig godt paa vores hostel. Navnet tegner til at det kun kan blive sjovt ""Monkey Janes Guesthouse"" med tagbar! :D"
Fredag den fÃ¸rste oktober er den dag oktoberfesten starer i Kina. Det resulterede i at der kl. 12 i nat startede et KÃMPE fyrvÃ¦rkeri som gav genlyd i bjergene sÃ¥ vi troede vi var under angreb! Og selvom solen stÃ¥r op afholder det ikke kinserne fra at skyde fyrvÃ¦rkeri af sÃ¥ vi blev ogsÃ¥ vÃ¦kket af en dejlig omgang heksehyl! Dert gjorde dog ikke sÃ¥ meget da den bare stod pÃ¥ pakning hvorefter vi skulle tjekke ud. Vi rÃ¸g ned i byen til den samme morgenmad ...
"Hey,We are now in Guilin, towards the south of China, after a 27hr overnight train (with NO airconditioning). This is the Chinese 'Lake District'!!! Hills, mountains, lakes and lots of scenery, and possibly the only place with KFC's that dont have chicken burgers - you get whole crayfish in a burger form, very tasty though...but not as tasty as the local food, never seen so many chillies in some of the dishes but they are tasty.Its sunny and hot here and we even tried our hand at bamboo rafting near the Reed Flute Caves. We are using this as a bit of a rest stop before ehading to Yangshun and the Li River which is meant to be the most beautiful part of China. From there its off to Kunming to walk Tiger Leaping Gorge before heading down to Vietman for some beaches and some surfing.Hope you are all enjoying the pictures, it might be a while before we can get anymore on here, but we havent forgotten about you all.Love Rich and Em xxx"

"Nigel: Guilin is famous for its stunning karst topography but most people have come to hear about the place as a result of the HSBC advert which shows fishermen using cormorant birds to catch fish. Though the famous Li River does run through the centre of Guilin, the fishing doesn't actually occur here. Instead it happens in Yangshou which will be our next entry. Guilin is surrounded by very tall, lush mountains which are curved at the tops. Many historical figures and world leaders, including Bill Clinton, have been quoted as saying how beautiful the place is and luckily we weren't dissapointed either. The city has both a picturesque feel but also a modern one as well. There are an abundance of shops within the centre, however, a 5 minute walk and you can be next to one of the many beauty spots or by the riverside. Our hostel was right next to the river and from the lobby you could watch people wading across  a shallow section where there was a cobbled area. Many people waded across. Some very slowly and some practically ran across. We were apprehensive about doing it ourselves but our night crossing of the stepping stones in Fenghuang had given us some confidence and we decided we couldn't go without attempting it. I'll let Alison finish the story becomes it still gives me nightmares....   Â  Alison: Guilin wasn't the small quaint place that I thought it would be but still some beautiful scenery can be seen if you look beyond the busy town center. Just outside the main shopping area are a few large lakes which were very attractive, especially as the sun was going down when we were there. The usual 'celebrity westerner' status continued here and we had some photos taken but this time we turned the camera on them as well. They were very bemused to have their picture taken too! About a 10 minute walk from town brings you to a very large park called the Seven Star Park and it is well worth a visit. There are lots of walking routes in the park with monkeys and peacocks running around freely. There are also several caves to explore. The biggest cave was good when we first went in because different coloured lights were used to make the caves look spectacular and to highlight various natural rocks that were supposed to look like various things e.g. 'beautiful lady washing her hair'?! We went in to the cave just behind a large Chinese tourist group and after a while the tour guide talking loudly down her microphone in Chinese and the slow pace of the crowd, began to annoy us a bit so we decided to overtake. It was only then that we realised that they were only turning the spectacular lighting on for the Chinese tourist group. We walked through the rest of the cave in darkness and a bit miffed that the lights never came on for us. At the end of the cave we noticed a deep cavern which looked as though it would have water at the bottom. Nigel decided to put an end to the wondering and without really thinking it through, lobbed a stone down it. Instead of clunk, clunk, clunk, splash, we heard clunk, clunk, clunk, smash! Guess that section of caves spectacular lighting, won't be as impressive as the others :-/ And now to the river crossing.....we didn't get very far. In fact, I never even left the bank. To get on to the under water cobbled bit, you have to walk down a few steps. Bearing in mind the heat that day, I recommended that we take our flip flops off when we were at the bottom of the steps so we could dip straight in to the cool water without burning our feet on the steps. However, in typical Nigel style, before I had even finished my sentence, flip flops were off and he was running down the steps with the smell of burning flesh in the air. Though I had seen people practically running across, I had never seen anyone run straight on to the slimy cobbles. I think you probably know what's coming......only one step on to the cobbles and he dramatically falls flat on his back fully clothed!! Luckily no serious injury was sustained and my first aid kit had it's debut to patch up his wounded finger :-)   Â    Â    Â"
"And when a G&T is necessary, do you think they have any tonic water?*Good to see the Chinese education system is teaching the important stuff to its English students."
"SÃ¥ var dagen kommet for Ã¥ forlate Hong Kong med retning Guilin, som skal vÃ¦re Kinas vakreste by. Vi presset alt stuffet vÃ¥rt i alle lommer og kriker og kroker, i bÃ¥de sekk og hÃ¥ndbagasje. Noe mÃ¥tte vi derfor vi adjÃ¸ til, slik som vÃ¥re rutete bager (Du sa ikke ifra tidsnok, Anniken.) og Ellen Maries rosa  hÃ¥ndkle. Ellers fikk vi utrolig nok presset alt sammen og hastet ned til skyttelen vÃ¥r, som plutselig var klar 10 minutter fÃ¸r den opprinnelige tida (og 10 min fÃ¸rvi var klare). Vi startet dagen med Ã¥ finne ut at det nÃ¥ var meldt tyfonvarsel nivÃ¥ 3, som betyr sterk vind. NervÃ¸se satt vi derfor bare Ã¥ ventet pÃ¥ at flyet vÃ¥rt skulle bli avlyst nÃ¥r vi ankom flyplassen. Da flyet ikke ble kansellert, var vi urolige pÃ¥ om vi skulle overleve dette. Det viste seg imidlertid at denne frykten var helt bortkasta, siden det var minimal turbulens og vi landet trygt i Guilin. Jeg ble stoppet pÃ¥ febersjekk pÃ¥ flyplassen, der jeg mÃ¥tte ha et termometer under armen i 5 minutter for Ã¥ mÃ¥le. Skulle vel tro at de kunne effektivisert det litt mer, dersom de hadde kosta pÃ¥ seg noen litt mer avanserte temperaturmÃ¥lere. Ved siden av meg satt en gutt, med en far som sÃ¥ lettere nervÃ¸s ut. Han kneppet nemlig opp genseren til gutten, slik at han skulle bli mindre varm og stod ""diskret"" bak gutten og viftet bahn i nakken. Utrolig nok sÃ¥ vi hverken gutten eller faren videre etter denne sjekken... I ankomsthallen stod alle de snikete taxisjÃ¥fÃ¸rene klare for Ã¥ kjÃ¸re oss til hotellet. Det hÃ¸rer med til historien at vi kvelden i forveien avbestilte vÃ¥rt opprinnelige hotell, etter Ã¥ ha lest omtalene der stikkordene var mÃ¸rkt, rÃ¸ykfult, mugg og prostituerte. Alternativet var Sheraton hotel, et 5 stjerners hotell som faktisk var 5 ganger sÃ¥ dyrt. Taximannen kunne ikke en fnugg engelsk, men en annen mann snakket til han pÃ¥ kinesisk sÃ¥ vi satt oss i bilen og kjÃ¸rte av gÃ¥rde. Dette var min fÃ¸rste opplevelse med taxi i Kina , noe som var en erfaring i seg selv. Her er bryr de seg ikke om sikkerhet i det hele tatt. PÃ¥ motorveien kjÃ¸rte vi forbi alt som var av kjÃ¸rende gjenstander. Gutter pÃ¥ moped, som ikke engang har pÃ¥ seg sko! I byen hadde de fylt mopenene med sÃ¸ppel, eller babyer som satt og holdt styret! Mange bra fotomotiv med andre ord! SjÃ¥fÃ¸ren vÃ¥r sÃ¥ ut til Ã¥ ha en trang etter Ã¥ kjÃ¸re forbi alt foran oss, til tross for at det ikke alltid Ã¥ ut som vi skulle rekke det fÃ¸r den andre bilen mot oss kom, eller at den bilen ved siden av oss kom farlig nÃ¦rme bÃ¥de titt og ofte. Etter en taxitur der vi nok en gang sÃ¥ dÃ¸den i hvitÃ¸yet, ankom vi vÃ¥rt fineste hotell i lÃ¸pet av turen. Siden vi var sent ute, var det kun deluxe rom som var ledige. Og for et rom! Utsikt til elva, badekÃ¥per, flatskjerm, tÃ¸fler, radio pÃ¥ do. You name it- We`ve got it! Detta er livet! I rusen av all luksusen bestlite vi inroom dining, et valg som viste seg Ã¥ vÃ¦re utmerket. God mat!Dagen etter reiste vi elvecruise pÃ¥ elven opp til Yangshou, som skal vÃ¦re en obligatorisk bÃ¥ttur mens man er i disse trakter. Dagen startet tidlig, og etter Ã¥ ha ventet pÃ¥ utallige folk som ogsÃ¥ skulle vÃ¦re med pÃ¥ bussen bort til havna, stÃ¥tt ""tilfeldigvis"" i en giftshop og venta pÃ¥ billettene, stÃ¥tt ute i regnet for Ã¥ vente pÃ¥ bÃ¥t, var vi igang. Vi fikk en brosjyre der de hadde listet inn vi viktigste sightene og vi ventet i spenning. Plutselig dukker det opp en mann utenfor vinduet som holdt opp ulike ting, slik som bananer og grÃ¸nne figurer, som han hÃ¥pte vi ville kjÃ¸pe. hehe..stod over den gitt. Vi stod oppe pÃ¥ dekk og betraktet de vakre grÃ¸nne fjellene, morgendisen som laseg rundt og kuer og mennesker som jobbet langs elvebredden. Og sÃ¥ var det dags for sights. For Ã¥ vÃ¦re Ã¦rlig sÃ¥ lignet de fleste fjellene pÃ¥ hverandre og kineserne har nok hatt det gÃ¸y med Ã¥ finne pÃ¥ navn til de forskjellige hÃ¸ydepunktene, slik som det ene fjellet der det skulle vÃ¦re mange hester, eller fjellet med mannen med skjegget. Hehe...underholdningsverdi absolutt, og naturen rundt oss var vakker, uansett om vi ikke sÃ¥ hestene eller den skjeggete mannen.  PÃ¥ ett punkt kunne vi betrakte samme motivet som de har pÃ¥ den kinesiske 20 lappen. Det var jo litt stas=o)Inne i bÃ¥ten fikk vi utdelt tradisjonell kinesisk mat, i form av smÃ¥retter som bordet vÃ¥rt pÃ¥ 6 mennesker delte. Ovenfor oss satt et kinsesisk par, som nok sÃ¥ underholdsningsverdien av oss mens vi spiste. Vi fikk nemlig kun spisepinner Ã¥ spise med, noe som var helt nytt for meg. Jeg satt derfor og klÃ¸na veldig, sÃ¥ mannen over meg prÃ¸vde Ã¥ vise meg hvordan jeg skulle gjÃ¸re det, uten hell. Etterhvert fikk jeg uansett brukt pinnene til Ã¥ skyve maten inn i munnen og etter Ã¥ ha brukt 30 min (eller mer) pÃ¥ 1 bit kjÃ¸tt, 2 blomkÃ¥lbiter, noen bÃ¸nnespirer og en liten bolle ris, sa jeg meg ferdig. Maten var god da, og det var vel vÃ¥rt fÃ¸rste kinesiske mÃ¥ltid her i Asia. Fremme i Yangshaou prÃ¸vde guiden vÃ¥r i herdig Ã¥ selge oss enda en tur, selv om vi hadde nevnt flere ganger at vi ikke hadde penger. Cruiset i seg selv var relativt dyrt, sÃ¥ den neste turen burde vÃ¦rt inkludert syns nÃ¥ vi. Dette resulterte i at vi, istedet for de to timene vi skulle traske rundt i Yangshaou, mÃ¥tte traske rundt i 3,5 timer. NÃ¥ er ikke Yangshaou en stor by, og det var utrolig varmt ogsÃ¥ denne dagen sÃ¥ vi var litt oppgitt over denne lÃ¸sningen. Yansghou var nok en vakker by da, med mange innslag av vestlige kafeer o.l. Byen skal visstnok vÃ¦re et backpacker paradis og mange sier den er enda vakrere enn Guilin. Tiltross for vÃ¥re mange timer med ihjelslÃ¥ing av tid, hjadde vi ikke sjangs til Ã¥ rekke Ã¥ se veldig mye av byen, kun sentrum. Og noe sier meg at det ikke er sentrum som har gitt byen rykte om Ã¥ vÃ¦re vakker... Sultne og varme gikk fÃ¸rste ferden for Ã¥ finne et sted vi kunne sitte med air con... Og jammen var det ikke en McDonalds her ogsÃ¥! En meget malplassert Macern, der den gule m-en lyser opp blant de vakre fjellene..huff...men vi gikk inn da. Billig mat pÃ¥ macern her i Kina! Vi fikk jo et helt mÃ¥ltid for 20 kroner! Det passer absolutt inn i vÃ¥rt budsjett=o)Etter Ã¥ ha trasket rundt litt, kjÃ¸pt noen kule postkort av en sur dame og tatt bilder, begynte vi Ã¥ lete etter hotellet der bussen skulle plukke oss opp og kjÃ¸re oss tilbake til Guilin. Kartet var hÃ¥ndtegnet med to steder: hotellet og der vi kom av, alstÃ¥ ikke veldig detaljert. Vi fulgte derfor en strategi som har vist seg Ã¥ funke pÃ¥ turen; FÃ¸lg etter folk som ser ut som de har samme destinasjon som deg selv. NÃ¥r vi gikk av bÃ¥ten tidligere pÃ¥ dagen fikk vi nemlig slike gratis vifter (som seff var et tegn som fortalte selgerne: Selg til meg! Selg til meg! Jeg har brukt masse penger pÃ¥ cruise og er dum nok til Ã¥ kjÃ¸pe mer her!) og vi fant en hel gjeng der alle viftet iherdig mens de gikk i retning av noe som kunne vÃ¦re hotellet vi lette etter. Noe som var riktig. Der satt vi og ventet i over en time, fÃ¸r bussen kom og kjÃ¸rte oss tilbake. Nok en gang slitne og lite lystne pÃ¥ nudler, ble det in room dining i badekÃ¥per.Bare fordi vi kan=o)Siste dagen vÃ¥r i Guilin gikk vi rundt pÃ¥ egenhÃ¥nd i byen. Vi sÃ¥ Elephant trunk hill, som en en steinformasjon som ligner en elefantsnabel (ligger i ordet egentlig). Carina ble angrepet av en noe agressiv roseselgende 5Ã¥ring (eller der omkring, skal ikke skryte pÃ¥ oss Ã¥ kunne aldersbestemme barn..), og omrÃ¥det rundt parken var i det store og det hele preget av litt dÃ¥rlige forhold, med mye tigging, selging og slitne mennesker. Men selve elefantparken var kjempefin (selv om vi lenge var i tvil om vi gadd Ã¥ betale inngangsbilletten pÃ¥ 30kr..) I parken ble sÃ¦rlig Carina en av de store turistattraksjonene, og hun pryder nok en del kinesiske fotoalbum i tiden som kommer.. Gleden var ogsÃ¥ stor da de oppdaget at det var to av oss, og flere bilder mÃ¥tte knipses.. Etter en vellykket fotosesion (som for noen av oss fÃ¸ltes veldig bra), satte vi nesen mot ett par templer vi hadde sett i nÃ¦rheten. De var hÃ¸ye og rare, sÃ¥ vi stilte oss opp og knipset noen bilder av dem fÃ¸r vi trasket videre. Vi fant fort ut at omrÃ¥det bak hotellet var en kjempestor handlegate, litt nedtur at bagasjen vÃ¥r allerede er sÃ¥ altfor full! Vi trasket opp og ned gata noen ganger, siklet litt i butikkvinduene og spiste oss litt eksklusiv mat pÃ¥ Macrn (som vi faktisk lette etter for Ã¥ spise der..). Vi avsluttet kvelden med et lite bad i bassenget, rett og slett fordi vi hadde betalt for det. Det mÃ¥ innrÃ¸mmes at dette var litt kaldt klokken Ã¥tte pÃ¥ kvelden, men hva gjÃ¸r man vel ikke for Ã¥ fÃ¥ valuta for pengene? Etter en Ã¸kt med intensiv pakking avsluttet vi kvelden med Ã¥ se en film fÃ¸r vi sovnet."
"Hey All,On Sunday we walked to the 'Big WIld Goose Pagoda'. It ended up being quite a hot sunny day. We watched an amazing dancing fountain show, where the fountains movements where choreographed to music. We entered the grounds of the pagoda and were met by some truely amazing sights - beautiful buddhist buildings, quiet scenic spots, walks through pretty gardens, pretty little pagoda's in the gardens and interesting stone carvings.In the evening, we went for a stroll along Xi'an city walls. (Xi'an is one of the few remaining cities in China with an intact wall surrounding it's city centre). It felt like we were walking in the clouds, high above the city. We decided in the end to walk the whole wall, which was 9km after originally planning to do half of it. It was tiring but definately worth it for the views we had.Yesterday we packed our bags and headed to the airport, it was pouring with rain so we bought a couple of umbrellas as the bus stop was quite a walk away. We got plenty of funny looks and stares (westeners - and with big rucksacks!) :-) The whole day it poured with rain, just like a typical English summers day really but a bit warmer. We caught our evening flight to Guilin, a smalish city further south in China. The Air China flight was about 1 hour 30 min, and the food was surprisingly good compared with what we expected! :-) We arrived at Guilin and got our bags almost immediately. We had booked a transfer and the man was there to pick us up in a lovely air conditoned car, its really hot here. About 32 deg when we arrived at 9pm! We stayed last night in a nearby hostel as the  place we had booked was full. Today we moved to to the place we booked and it is lovely. Out of the window we can see the pagodas that are in the picture above. We are off out now to explore the city a bit. Will update you soon.LoveHol and PetexXx"
"sorry about not updating the old blog for abit, the computer at the hostel we were stayin in didnt like to load this site for some reason..thursday: got a early start to catch our flight to guilin, in whitch we both turned into somthing of temporay celebrities being the only western people on the entire plane, having our photo taken with various family members and in diffenert poses countless times.. landing in guilin we were shocked as to how green everythin was, propper lush country side with huge towering mountains and a more tropical climate. truely beautiful. then went to our hotel in yangshaou and hired some bike to explore the river side and got some lunch at a kool little resturant on the river front. we then went to this israeli bar in the center town and ended up on cocktails..Friday: first day of rain! super propper cats and dogs f***in pissin it down. walked to bus staion to then catch our small bus out to the small town xingping, where we found our hostel which was really really nice, rooftop terrace, pool table, home made pizza's good find. brought some umbrellas and donning macs went for a walk in the rain to find the veiw which is famously printed on the back of the chinese 20 yen note. we then met a couple from new zealand, ardian and sharon and got some pizzas for the night.sat: had a massive lie in to get up at 11 to find the hole town flooded, completely and utterly cut off, the rain had ment that the river burst it banks and flooded the hole town. we retreated to the roof terrace for some pigs and about 15 minuits later were surprised of the arrivivle of about 30 odd army,news and goverement officals doin filmin and checkin out the flood, slightly sureal.. we then found a basket ball and a ghetto basket ball court and played that for about 2 hours ( luke won). got abit drunk later and luke fell over, was f***in helairous.sunday: had breakfast of sweet and sour chicken, and spicy beef noodles ( bored of pizza's by this point) met up with nz couple at the hostel and went on a ""boat trip"" this consisted of walkin about 30 minutes down the river bank to spend 10 minutes on a boat deflecting massive china sized bugs and getting wet (again). had some more beers on the roof and chilled with some music. we have also decided to go snowboarding in new zealand seein as its the season and all..love to all and pics soon, hopefully.. x"
"Hello and welcome back after a break in Hong Kong. I am now in Guilin with the beautiful graceful Louise (according to her new Chinese name) after a mad few days in HK.I was there on June 4th - the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square. There was a huge gathering in Victoria Park, with candles and singing. I asked what time the free speech was supposed to start, but nobody seemed to know....Actually it was very moving, even though apart from a video montage, I didn't actually understand anything. It was humbling to see so many people out in force in the only part of China which is allowed to protest.Hong Kong is hot, sticky, crowded, confusing, noisy - and fun. The waterfront and the skyscrapers are amazing. My taxi driver was called Wong Kar Wo, which didn't bode well, but luckily he didn't live up to his name. The hotel was fantastic (as was the view from our 31st floor room), the food we had was great and we saw some interesting sights as well - the longest escalator in the world (next to the smuggest ex-pat bar in the world), amazing views from The Peak, and a crazy packed-out market - still not really sure who was selling what to whom...My first meal (before Louise arrived) was interesting. I sat down in a huge restaurant, where I was the only westerner in a room of about 200 people. No-one seemed to want to take my order, but there was a ""scorecard"" in Chinese which I scribbled a couple of ""1""s on, and that seemed to do the trick. A Chinese gentleman sat down opposite me,ordered, and received a 3 course meal - I got four tiny rugby-ball shaped things, and as if to compensate for this paucity, the biggest bottle of beer in the world. I knew I'd ordered twofood items, but only one appeared. I finished everything - very slowly - and the guy opposite had been and gone to be replaced by another, who was also getting his food. I was about to leave when three dim sum turned up - hurrah! I was not to starve after all- patience is obviously a virtue in Hong Kong.That certainly seems to be true of walking around - it's nearly impossible, no-one seemed to be bothered about getting anywhere except in our way.Louise described it as a meandering style, which we saw them training their kids in early. Very frustrating.Now in Guilin, where the view would be exactlylike the photo above - if only there was a view through the mist. Never mind, boat trip booked for tomorrow- hopefully the fog will lift. All together - fog on the Li is all mine, all mine..."
Li River Cruise
"Vrijdag 8 mei 2009 - Yangshuo (door Marleen)Wat kun je leren van het nachtleven van de Chinezen? Dat je je vooroordelen beter kan laten varen en dat een 'vette bek' halen een internationale behoefte is na een nachtje doorhalen. De Chinezen swingen de hele avond op de dansvloer, dragen soms ultrakorte broeken en rokjes en geven bakken geld uit. (Een biertje kost al gauw 3,5 Euro, maar voor dat geld krijg je ook een cocktail. In China kun je voor dat bedrag met zijn tweeen uit eten, dus goedkoop is het niet.) Er wordt zelfs gedanst op Vanilla Ice, waarbij wij luidkeels 'Rice, Rice baby' meezingen. De palen en podia worden goed gebruikt. Het is de bedoeling dat je je eerst met veel tegenwerpingen erop laat duwen, maar als je er eenmaal op staat, ga je los alsof je het dagelijks doet ( je kont schudden op een klein platform en daarna je benen sierlijk rond een paal zwieren). Ook Jeroen en ik moeten eraan geloven en proberen naar beste kunnen te doen alsof ook wij de kunst beheersen. Er wordt vanaf een uur of 10 flink gefeest, tegen enen wordt het stiller binnen. De straat vult zich dan met mensen die zattig nog meer bier tot zich nemen of stokjes sate verorberen. Het lijkt Nederland wel! We worden door dronken Chinezen uitgenodigd om een biertje te proosten, maar na het proosten verstompt het gesprek. Wij kunnen geen Chinees, zij geen Engels. Nog maar eens proosten dan!Zaterdag 9 mei - YangshuoVandaag doen we niet veel. Slapen lekker uit, internetten, genieten van het mooie weer en geven geld uit aan nieuwe kleren. 's Avonds eten we voor de laatste keer in ons favoriete restaurant hier (en eigenlijk ook van de afgelopen 8 maanden): Pure Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant. Het eten is zooooo goddelijk, dat we bijna nog een dag in Yangshuo willen blijven, puur om er nog eens te kunnen genieten van al dat lekkers.Zondag 10 mei - Yangshuo - Ping'anWe zullen ons restaurantje echt gaan missen, dus vertrekken we met gepaste tegenzin. We moeten van onszelf weer eens rijstterrassen bekijken.... (Okee, we houden wel van rijst en ook van terrassen, maar ik geloof dat ik mijn rijstterrassen taks wel bijna heb bereikt!) De eerste bus brengt ons terug naar Guilin en 'trakteert' ons onderweg op de meest afschuwelijke, wrede en bloederige film die we onderweg in bussen (of misschien wel ooit) hebben gezien. De film opent met een een zeer geweldadige verkrachtingsscene, met messen en bloed (let wel, het is ongeveer 10 uur 's ochtends en we zitten in een streekbus!), waarna ik stop met kijken en een boek ga lezen. Na een tijdje van zinloos bloedvergieten neemt de held wraak en dan is het hek echt van de dam. Ledematen en hoofden worden afgehakt, rompen doorkliefd en iemand wordt vastgespijkerd, waarna zijn arm wordt overgoten met brandbenzine en wordt aangestoken. Alles wordt gruwelijk plastisch in beeld gebracht, aldus Jeroen, want ik zie er nauwelijks iets van.In Guilin aangekomen gaan we op het treinstation een kaartje kopen voor de trein die we woensdag gaan nemen. (We voelen onszelf echt reuze planvaardig en georganiseerd!) Daarna nemen we een bus naar Lonsheng, ten noorden van Guilin. Vanaf Longsheng is het nog ongeveer een uur naar Ping'an. Een klein dorpje temidden van rijstterrassen, waar we na 8 uur bussen aankomen.Ping'an is klein, maar de huizen zijn enorm groot en hoog en geheel berekend op de komst van toeristen. We huren voor 3 euro pp. (ik bedoel maar, een biertje voor 3,5 euro is toch echt onvoorstelbaar?) een mooie geheel nieuwe kamer die erg ruikt naar een sauna en er ook precies zo uit ziet. Heerlijke houtgeur en een eigen badkamer met heerlijk warme douche! Zoals verwacht bouwen de Chinezen echt als idioten, maar de kwaliteit is daar ook naar. Overal hangt de bedrading in het zicht en vaak is het badkamer meubilair bevestigd met niet al te veel perfectie. Niks hangt op 90 graden en je wil je geen voorstelling maken hoe onze badkamer er over 3 jaar uit zal zien (dan is ie oud, volgens de Chinezen).We eten in een restaurantje waar ze groente voor ons op de BBQ gooien. We hadden de eigenaar in de bus ontmoet, leuke gast. 's Avonds worden we uitgenodigd voor een lokale dans en zang voorstelling: gratis vandaag omdat het moederdag is! De voorstelling blijkt erg leuk, met dames en heren van 3 verschillende minderheidsgroepen uit deze regio. Ze dragen hun speciale kleding en zingen erg Chinees en erg hard. Af en toe moet ik wel denken aan een krolse kat, maar overwegend toch wel zuiver. Jeroen laat zich nog even van zijn beste kant zien. Hij doet mee met de stok-tik-dans en wint uiteindelijk de competitie. Helemaal glunderend van trots ontvangt hij als prijs een boekje met de geschiedenis van de regio (helaas allemaal in het Chinees).Maandag 11 mei - Ping'anVandaag gaan we op sjouw met de gids-vrouw. De zus van onze hoteleigenares neemt ons mee op pad naar Dhazai. Dat is een flink eind lopen (volgens de LP drie uur, maar die maken waarschijnlijk geen foto's onderweg). Onze gids (Ti-ing) spreekt redelijk Engels, waardoor we ook weer een beetje meer leren over de Chinese cultuur. Zo mag met de 1-kind politiek elk Chinees koppel maar 1 kind krijgen, maar als je tot een bepaalde culturele groep hoort (bv de Yao) dan mag je er twee krijgen. Goed dat wist ik dan nog wel, maar blijkbaar gaat het nog verder. Behoor je tot de Zhuang-groep, dan mag je 1 zoon krijgen, krijg je een dochter, dan mag je het nog eens proberen. Die mogen er dan dus twee. Ti-ing was van de Zhuang en had inmiddels een dochter van 15 maanden. Dat leek me dus wel mazzel voor haar, maar nee dat had ik toch verkeerd gezien. Kinderen zijn duur, ze wilde er maar een en had dus toch pech met de dochter.Ti-ing is een leuke meid en erg geduldig met onze foto-pauzes (Jeroen trouwens ook). In het begint regent het een beetje, maar even later komt het echt met bakken uit de lucht. Ze kijkt bezorgd naar ons, maar we banjeren stug door. Gelukkig is het vanaf 12.00 uur wel grotendeels droog gebleven.Wat zien we vandaag? Rice, rice baby! Rijst velden in de regen, in de wolken en onder de modder. Veel hard werkende mensen, graftombes tussen de rijstvelden en vele grote houten huizen en dorpjes. Al met al toch een erg mooie tocht. We lunchen in Zhontui (?), waar speciaal voor ons iemand een restaurantje maakt van haar woonkamer en we kunnen genieten van heerlijke noodle soup. Er lopen bijna 10 kinderen rond in oranje jasjes waar 'Van Nistelrooij, Holland' op staat, dus pakken we onze Hollands-glorie postkaart er weerbij en gebaren dat wij dus uit 'Holland' komen. Ja, inderdaad, net als jouw jas. Jeroen jaagt een jongetje van vijf de stuipen op het lijf door bij de wc te wachten tot het jongetje klaar is. Het jongetje ziet de reus voor de deur staan en durft niet meer naar buiten te komen! Na het eten (noodle soup met stokjes, dat is weer wat geleerd!) toont de vrouw des huizes ons haar enorm lange haren. Een vrouw knipt hier slechts twee keer in haar leven haar haar: voordat ze gaat trouwen en nadat ze twee kinderen heeft gekregen. Deze twee enorme staarten haar bewaar je en bind je dan op je hoofd met je andere haar, wat dan samen een enorme bos is. Zo is Shakira waarschijnlijk op het idee gekomen.Dinsdag 12 mei - Ping'an - GuilinWe doen het in de ochtend rustig aan; maken zelf koffie (want hier krijg je bij elke kamer altijd heet water, pure verwennerij) en lopen al souvenirsshoppend tegen 10.00 naar de bus. Onderweg in Lonsheng lunchen we in een ik-wijs-aan-wat-ik-wil-eten restaurantje, wat resulteert in een kom heerlijke groenten en noodles. Doordat we niet echte vleeseters zijn, lopen we veel lekkers mis: vacuum verpakte kippenpoten als snackje, gefrituurde eekhoorn, rat of slang, kwarteltjes op een stokje van de bbq, strottenhoofdjes van koeien en varkens of een bord vol kippenhoofdjes om maar wat locale lekkernijen te noemen. Tegen 16.00 uur zijn we in Guilin, waar we weer spotgoedkoop een kamer hebben en onze tijd vullen met internetten."
"Fortsaettelse af blog fra en Bollywood-stjerne - nu DIVA!!! :-)Ja, jeg har jo egentlig SLET ikke tid til at skrive til jer, da mine fans ogsaa kraever en del tid! Ikke nemt efter at jeg ar faaet sat gang i min glimrende skuespillerkarrierre i Indien...ja, det straaler aabenbart ud af mig at jeg er en helt klar lysende stjerne paa Indiens film-himmel, saa alleredse dagen efter, spurgte een mig om jeg var skuespiller, for jeg ""ligner en Bollywood-stjerne""! :-)Min dag startede med afhentning af en noget skeptisk Agnete, der ikke var for begejstret eller ositivt stemt, foerst og fremmest over at skulle vaere klar kl 6.30!!! og derudover at opdage at visiscardet som jeg fik af gutten der headhuntede mig, sagde ""agency for foreign models""...saa ringede en beskyldende dansker lige og spurgte hvad undertonen der betoed...men han forsikrede mig at Bollywood altsaa ikke lavede pornofilm, og han blev ret fornaermet over mine antydninger! Men nej, alt var ogsaa ganske i orden (og nu kan jeg jo saa kalde mig model...det er da vist aarhundredets joke, der maa gerne grines hoejt!). detr vrimlede med andre (selvfoelgelig ikke naer saa smukke) turister paa settet, som var i filmbyen, med vores egen lille have omformet til en ashram; Sai Baba-tempel! I de andre smaa ""haver"" var der helnholdsvis forsakellige smaa settings, bl.a. en victoriansk landsby, et palads, en Rasajstahn-landsby osv. I vores vrimlede det med mennesker, skuespillere, lydfolk, lysmaend, skrigende directors osv. Etr stort kaos! Men jeg (vi udelader lige de andre turister her, saa lyder det mere som om jeg var noget specielt) blev fragtet til ""min"" gardarobe-vogn, hvor jeg fik mit ""kostume"", en 1990'er stylet ret nedringet bluse, som jeg skulle forestille at dyrke yoga i i stegende hede i morgensolen! Men jeg fik jo en taekkelig loen af hele 55kr for 12 timers arbejde samt dehydrering, saa jeg var naturligvis tilfreds! Sjov sjov oplevelse var det at se, og snakke med nogle af skuespillerne som viste sig at vaere nogle store kanoner i landet! Efter dagens strabadser vendte jeg hjem til min ""vaertsfamilie"" som ogsaa bor i omraadet med alle de rige og beroemte...intet mindre kan jo goere det for saadan en stjerne som mig:-)Derefter var det videre til Kina!"
20th April - Day 173 - Guilin
"After the Yangshuo trip, me and two of my Italian friends and one Finnish girl continued our trip to the next city. We took a bus to place called Guilin. It was much bigger a city than Yangshuo but very beautiful also. In the evening we just walked around the city little bit but went to bed pretty early. We had booked a whole day trip to Longshen and Dragon Backbone Rice terraces, so we had to wake up early.Next morning we left the city at 8 am. We decided to attend a basic group trip, just to save our time. The 10-hour trip cost 16 Euros, so it was not a bad choice either when thinking about travelers' budget. At first we went to see some small villages where some of the locals still lived traditionally like they have lived for decades. For example, all the girls and women in the village haven't ever cut their hair. They still hide their hair under the hat until they get married. After that they'll do they hair everyday in similar way. If they have a bun made of hair in their forehead, it means that they have given a birth to a baby. In the village we went to see a traditional music and dance show. After seeing the village, we drove to Longshen Rice terraces. They were just incredible! We walked about an hour to get to the top of the mountain to see all the beautiful sights, but it was definitely worth it! We also had a lunch in the 600 year old village which was in our way to the top. We tried a local speciality: bamboo rice and bamboo chicken. Our guide was talking English the whole day so it was very nice to get a lot of information. Everything we saw was so interesting. After getting back to Guilin, unfortunately we had to take a bus back to Guangzhou so we would be back at school on time next morning. The trip was pretty rought because we did so much during such a short time, but it was absolutely one of the best trips I have ever done! I really recommend everyone to go at least to Yangshuo, but if you have time, take a trip to see the rice terraces also!"
"Today we go rafting around Yangshuo. The rafts are monopolised by a short and fat man who won't be shifted on his price. His phone goes off during negotiations - it is gold plated. On seeing this we silently admit defeat and pay the price demanded. He barks orders at one of the raft men. Farmers guide their oxen across the shallow river and some locals swim from one side to the other. It is a peaceful ride down the calm river, interrupted only by a brief water ..."
"Hey allesammen.Nu faar jeg endelig taget mig sammen til at skrive paa bloggen igen. Efter at have skrevet den bedste opdatering der blev slettet i Beijing, blev jeg en smule irriteret paa computere og lagde det derfor lidt paa hylden. Haaber ikke min kaere familie har lidt for meget under dette :DBeijing var super fantastisk, og der er ingen tvivl om at jeg tager tilbage dertil naar chancen byder sig. Menneskene var meget imoedekommende, og naesten saa meget at Nanna og jeg til tider foelte os som kendte mennesker der ikke kunne gaa 5 meter uden at folk ville have billeder af os. Specielt vildt var det ved Bird's Nest - OL stadiumet, hvor vi min. fik taget 15 billeder af os den dag. Vi fik brugt ugen paa at shoppe, spise paa de laekreste restauranter, bl.a. skal naevnes byens bedste indiske restaurant, kaaret i 2008, se sevaerdigheder, trekke paa den kinesiske mur og moede de sjoveste mennesker. Det mest maerkvaerdige er dog de smaa babyers hul i bukserne til numsen/foran, saa de til hver en tid bare kan saette sig ned paa gaden og tisse. Mon ikke de faar en ordentlig gang blaerebetaendelse taenkte vi saa, men den tanke fik vi aflivet da vi spurgte en kineser. Dog er det mest nederen deres evige snotteri paa aaben gade - saa la' dog vaer naar jeg gaar lige foran jer!!Vi ankom til guilin for en uge siden i dag, og indtil videre har der vaeret blandede oplevelser. Det hele har vaeret super fedt hernede, med undtagelse af vejret, der praktisk taget bare har vaeret noget skidt. Det har regnet saa meget hernede, hele ugen, hvilket har mindsket vores begejstring over den ellers helt fantastiske natur der er her. Foerste dag vi ankom moedte vi to danske piger fra Gentofte omraadet, og en finner. (Foerste moede med en finner paa denne tur). De havde besluttet sig for at tage med bamboo river rafting ad Li River til den meget besoegte backpacker by Yangshou, og da de spurgte om vi var friske sagde vi ja med det samme. Det var en af de flotteste ture ned af den fantastiske flod (se billedet), der er omgivet af de frodigste bjerge. Vi sejlede i en lille bambus baad, alle fem, samt den soedeste kinesiske pige Angelina som kom til at udvide gruppen, og paa trods af regnen havde vi det super fedt. De naeste par dage i Yangshou, hvilket er en enestaaende by omgivet af store groenne bjerge, brugte vi egentlig ikke paa saa meget andet end at hygge helt vildt meget allesammen, spise taarne af laekre chokolade-mousse kager, slik, chips, drikke cola og se diverse film paa hostelet. Vejret forhindrede en ellers planlagt cykel tur rundt i omraadet som er en af de mest fortrukne beskaeftigelser der. Efter to dage tog vi tilbage til Gulin og indlogerede os selv paa Guilin flowers youth hostel igen. Regnen fortsatte, men draebte aldrig den danske solide hygge med godter og mad. Pigerne havde faaet en ny roommate som de i starten troede var fuld og bare laa og lugtede, lige indtil han om aftenen fortalte os, over nogle oel og vores delte flaske ris-vin, at han faktisk havde CYKLET hele vejen fra England til Kina og tilbage lagt sig en straekning paa 22.000 km. Herefter skal han fortsaette og naa Atlaska, cykle hele vejen ned til sydAmerika, og derfra til SydAfrika hvor han cykler igennem hele Afrika og og til sidst naar England igen. En tur han regner med kommer til at tage frem til 2011 - han har allerede vaeret af sted i et aar, og det mest fantastiske er at han goer dette for at samle sponsorer ind til SOS-Boernebyerne og han er KUN 22 aar. Jaa, der laerte vi at man skal doemme et mennske ud fra hans lugt. for man kan jo egentlig ikke bebrejde manden at han lugtede lidt da han laa og sov, efter at have koert 22.000 km ;)Til vores enorme aergelse tog pigerne igaar videre til Vietnam. Det var en skam, for vi har virkelig haft det hyggeligt sammen, men har aftalt at vi moedes naar vi kommer hjem. I stedet for er nogle nye danske piger kommet til, og det fede er at de tager videre til Katmandu nogle dage foer os, og skal vaere der i en maaned. Det er rigtig fint, for saa kan vi alle finde et faelles hostel. Det bliver hoejst sandsynligt Katmandu Guesthouse. Vi var med de samme piger ude og se ris-terresserne igaar, som er bjerge med ris-marker, der ligner smaa terresser. Vi var for foerste gang i lang tid heldige med vejret og fik oejeblikke deroppe hvor taagen lettede. Paa samme tur, trekkede vi igennem en lokal landsby, hvor en af kinas minoriteter bor. Hele landsbyen bestod af en familie/den samme familie, og det skal her naevnes at byen var ganske paen i stoerrelsen hvilket tyder paa en ordentlig gang indavl. Ganske interessant at opleve. Denne minoritetsgruppe er ogsaa en af de eneste befolkningsgrupper der maa faa 5 boern modsat flertallet af den kinesiske befolkning der lever efter et-barns politikken.Det sydlige Kina har indtil videre altsaa vaeret rigtig fedt, og klart et af de steder hvor vi har haft det rarest paa trods af regnen.Det skal lige naevnes at det er gaaet op for mig hvor meget danskerne snakker om mad i en saa vild begejstring naar de er samlet, at ingen andre nationaliteter kan foelge med. Mon det er vores samlingspunkt? Vores faelles livsglaede der lysner selv de moerkeste og mest regnfulde dage op?Jeg slutter af nu. Taenker paa jer, og savner lidt den danske fantastiske mad der ikke er til at sammenligne. Haaber at foraaret er kommet over jer og at i alle har det fantastisk.De kaerligste hilsner Maria."
"11 - 13 FebruaryThe train ride to Guilin was so dull. Twenty six hours on a hard sleeper seemed far longer than five days on the Trans Siberian Express. We were desperate to get off by the time I arrived.We booked two nights in a dorm room in Flowers Youth Hostel. The room was basic, but the social room was great. It had DVDs, a pool table and the occasional rat running through it, but that was something we would have to get used to. When we got off the train we got a KFC because everything was closed and headed straight to bed.Adam had a bad stomach the following day and we met a lad called Aaron in our dorm who we ended up spending a few days with.We didn't really have time to do much in Guilin, but we did go to Quixing Park, which was full of wild monkeys, mountains and caves that we could explore. We spent the whole day there and then at night we had a few beers.In the morning I took my first malaria pill and I was very ill, but we had to catch a bus to our new destination two hours away, the beauty that is Yangshuo."
"Hi everyone!Its our last day in Guilin today before we get the sleeper train tomorrow (for 22 hours) to Kunming. Guilin has been great! We did a tour down the Li river in a bamboo boat and the scenery was amazing! Yesterday we went to see some rice terraces but unfortunately it was to misty to see anything as it is the winter but the bus ride up and the scenery made up for it! We stayed in a little village called Ping-an which was an experience, it was totally ..."
"Ok I think this journal could be a little stop/start. I'm now on a train to Kunming after spending two nights in Yangshuo.Me, Matt J and Jonny arrived in Guilin from Changsha at 4am on the 2nd January. I managed to get my train ticket to Kunming (they weren't so lucky) then we waited for a while and found a McDonalds to hang out in until the buses to Yangshuo started at 8am.When we arrived at Yangshuo and checked into the hostel, first thing I did was have a nap, we'd got hardly any sleep on the train. Then I had a temperamental shower and we got some lunch. We then booked ourselves into a few sightseeing activites and rented a bike for the rest of the afternoon. We got a bit lost but it didn't matter, the weather was good and the scenery was beautiful.Back in Yangshuo, Jonny had a beer fish (the local delicacy) and we decided to try out some happy hours. At 7pm we joined a tourist boat to watch a man fishing with cormorants. It was pretty cool and afterwards he stopped and showed us what they'd caught.We had some BBQ a bit later (although it wasn't quite to the Hunan standard) then we stayed in the pubs for the rest of the night and even saw a live Chinese band.The next day we were up early and had an English breakfast then left the hostel at 10am to get on a bus for Yangdi. From there we planned to take a bamboo raft down the Li River but we got ambushed by old women selling fruit when we arrived, and it took a while to work out who's raft we were supposed to be on.The river cruise was beautiful and the weather was still good so we just relaxed for an hour. I think it'd be a perfect job for dad!When we got off the boat we caught a crazy taxi golf cart thing to the main town then sat on a sardine tin bus back to Yangshuo.We had a delicious Chinese meal in the sunshine next to the river, then we did some shopping. I learnt some bargaining skills from Jonny and I got a new coat. We then had a few beers and spent a lot of time in one bar where matt had lots of cocktails, played Connect 4 and had to impersonate animals, and Jonny became a teacher. That night wasn't too late and the next morning we checked out at 8:30am. After breakfast, Matt and Jonny got their bus back to Changsha and I spent some time on the internet then went for a walk in a park. I wasn't sure what to do but I found a path up a hill and at the top it was a great place to relax and read my book.I left Yangshuo at about 12:30pm along with Jonny's jeans that he'd left behind. On the bus a very friendly Singapore man talked to me and told me I should go to Singapore and I could stay with his family... He gave me lots of useful advice about where to go in China though.I arrived early in Guilin, posted my postcards then waited for my train to arrive. Once on the train I settled to read and sleep. This morning I awoke to beautiful sunshine and different scenery."
"Woke up late yet again and after getting ready Ruth and I went to the Yu Yuan Garden. It was a very pretty garden but there was so many people there that it took us a little while to get in. The garden was like a maze it had so many different paths and hidden areas to explore that you could've spent hours there but we didn't have much time as we were getting on a train that night to go to Guilin.After looking at the garden Ruth and I walked to the main shopping area to get some food and also look for an adapter, but I couldn't find one so we just go some food and had to race back to the hotel to met the rest of the group. We collected our things and got onto the bus and headed for the station.Again going through the process and lining up at security and fighting with the locals to get our bags scanned we made our way to the waiting room where we were again stared at. This train station was definitely the best out of all the stations as it was new and had escalators so made it easy to get onto the platform. We boarded the train at 5pm and this time I was sharing with Lindsay, Mario, Hayley, Kate and Siobhan. I got the bottom bunk again so I was happy."
"Ni Hao!Long time, no blog? What can i say, i've been busy. Photos will follow in due course, but in the meantime please accept my humble scribings as an update....also, i do check my message boards and email when i logon so please keep the messages coming, nice to hear some news from home once in a while As mentioned in an earlier missive, thoughts will fly at random down my arms and through the keypad so to make the most of my memory i shall log my most recent adventures in reverse chronological order:Today - 10th Nov - Returned from Long Ji Terraces to Guilin to catch the last of the overnight trains towards the border for Hong Kong eta 12 noon tomorrow.Yesterday - 9th Nov Hiked....yes HIKED...for 4 hours through the picturesque mountains and terraces from one village to another to change lodgings, every view was a postcard, so peaceful and green. Trod over old stone pathways, up and down mountains, through streams....some mud involved briefly, the sun shone but my traveller's hat kept me protected, the air was clean and warm - a lovely way to spend half the day.Arrived safe and sound at our new lodgings, simple but clean and fairly new - very chilly in the mountains, however, and what little warm clothes i had packed to trek with were all worn from the afternoon, nearly through all the night to the next day - sheets felt a bit damp, like the night before - but this time no cozy air-con for the room!Finished the night off with a show by some of the local ladies performing traditional folk dancing that dates back 500 years - great fun, some of our group were invited to return some entertainment, one sang 'Valerie' and another performed gymnastics. We all had a go at 'bamboo dancing' which involves skipping across a 'river' of clacking bamboo sticks that get progressively faster - i did ok, even in my flip flops...Shran, as a video will show, accidentally landed on one stick and broke it....all funny and in good spirits for the night. 2 of our group were 'married' and were asked to complete various courting dances including drinking rice wine! Great night. Tried the locally grown tea - yummy.8th Nov Woke up at the 'Outside Inn' and bused Guilin station - left our rucksacks at the Left Luggage - then bused to Long Ji Terraces and walked 1 hour to the first village where we would spend the night - so pretty here, local women of the villages are famous for growing very long hair on their heads - they wear it like hats! Quite cold and our group leader, Frank, negotiated free air-con for each room to warm things up - much appreciated! Quite funny, this lodge had only had electricity since February this year - the manager was running up and down the stairs helping start the air con machines - each model was slightly different!7th Nov 'All day' bike ride - in the rain - it did not stop but made the 'off road' part of the route quite an adventure - we waded through streams that had burst their banks, avoided puddles as best we could - i was drying my shoes for the next 2 days - this diminshed little the enjoyment we had. Lunched in a farmer's house, nice and simple, before voting for the 'short route' back to the Inn.6th Nov Yangshuo Fawlty Towers was the name of the hotel - the toilet only broke temporarily, other than that, cool - nice and near 'West Street' where all the bars and restaurants are located. Did Tai Chi in the morning with Master Yang, a friendly and impressive martial arts master - we even sparred a little - he could have broken me in 2 with his little finger! Then went Kayaking on part of the river Li - aprt from our group of 5 kayaks there was nobody else, and we were paddling down it for hours - so beautiful and tranquil.Transferred from Fawlty Towers to the Outside Inn before going for a swim, again in a part of the river (sorry dad - but the guide showed us a special part and i trust he wouldn't let us swim in poop!). Quick-drying towel worked, but left me covered in blue fluff - see the 'Superman' video if/when it gets posted.5th Nov Yangshuo Fawlty Towers - Whoa! I know Kung Fu. Completed an hour's tuition with the multi-talented Master Yang in the local park - learnt 20 moves....i remember 2.5! A good crack - rested most of the day before going to see a show near to the village - all performed outside on a lake - it was spectacular as about 300-400 actors were involved, with lights, singing, boats, animals, kids, costumes that lit up - all directed by a guy responsible for some of the opening ceremony to this year's Olympics. 4th Nov Arrived from the overnight train from Shanghai to Guilin, bused to Yangshuo Fawlty Towers - group meal in the evening, yummy beer fish which i think is locally caught/grown catfish cooked in beer! Then drank some of the night away, played a bit of pool with the group. Our group leader was encouraged to drink and snort a flaming cocktail by one of his bosses - thanks boss!3rd Nov Delicious lamb and naan in a muslim restaurant near the hotel,then said goodbye to Shangha - not sorry to be leaving here - a bit seedy, expensive, not easy to navigate. Overnight train to Guilin - no snoring Chinese this time, trip lasted for over 24 hours.2nd Nov Shanghai Visited the famous YuYuan Gardens in the centre of Shanghai - beautiful and marvellous buildings interwoven by koi-filled streams and rock gardens. Tried some Dim Sum at a 'famous' restaurant next door - like a mssive Dim Sum food court - turns out that Sharan and i ordered and ate and enjoyed Shark's Fin soup, along with several other delicacies. Finished the night off with a boat ride on the river viewing the spectacular buildings all lit up - visibility somewhat reduced by smog but good to get out from between all the buildings.1st Nov Shanghai - arrived at the station, taxi'd to our hotel - had a lovely meal in the restaurant next door. They served silkworms there, we didn't have any. Then did the orientation tour, not a lot to it and Shanghai is massive. Saw the Pearl Tower - impressive. Tried to visit the museum, but it was too late and closing - chatted with some friendly locals about this and that before returning to go out again - tried out one area, the 'bar street', limited options and expensive beers - we went out as a group of 12 in 3 taxi's - lost one taxi on the way, luckily Sharan saw the group walking along from one of the bars we chose about an hour later. We left some people watching footy in Oscar's, an Englishesque pub - to find better nightlife - a group of 6 of us, Martyn a wlsh guy, Isabelle a German, 2 Swedes Karin and Gunnar, and Sharan and i rolled up at a line of about 6 seedy looking bars - grabbed a beer in one laughing at the entertainment, avery happy looking Chinese singer with some sexy, loud-singing lady singers - we even helped sing Bryan Adams' classic - 'In Heaven' - Grabbed the delicious chicken burger from a stall and Sharan goit chatting to the next door club owner - he got us in free to his bar upstairs which was salsa, but the beer was cheap - Karin and Gunnar taught us all to salsa and we threw ourselves in to it. Top night in the end - a little concerned about coming out again to find lots of 'girls' in short skirts with adams apples lurking around - retired to our hotel, not before getting some street meat to fill our tummies 31st October - Overnight train from Xi'an to Shanghai - loved Xi'an, especially the bustling Muslim qurter - Frank told hilarious 'killer' stories as we played cards - we were eventually told to shut up by a guard and went to sleep"
"Oh, I totally forgot to say that while in Yongshou I went to watch a sound and light show on the river about traditional life in Youngshou, it was really well done and was cool to see, even though it was all in Mandarin and I didn't understand a word of it! ha ha. So after the bike ride day we packed our small back packs which we'd be trekking with and living out of for 3 days, and headed to Guilin train station. We checked in our big back packs and headed even..."
Hello everybody!! Guilin was a trip to remember. Its so beautiful there!!!!! Hot-air ballooning was great and so were the Karst towers/mountains.
"I had previously booked a ticket for a river trip from Guilin to Yangshuo. The scenery was amazing albiet hazy again. The river meandered its way south, and from the boat I was able to see many of the locals going on about their daily business on the river, with mountains making an beautiful backdropAmongst others, I hooked up with a nice Swiss couple on the boat, and once in Yangshuo checked into a local youth hostel. Chatted to several residents of the hostel over a beer or two. One of the travellers here is from Hove, small world.That evening went out to dinner and drinks with a few people from the hostel, and ended up in Monkey Janes Rooftop bar. After a few games of beer ping pong with Jane and some others in the bar I staggered back to the hostel via several more streets than I had original anticipated. Basically I got lost, since it was dark and all the bars had closed up I got a bit disorientated. More offers a massage........I must have really looked tired."
"We arrived last night in Moon Hill Village, near Yangshuo, China. With the darkness of the night cloaking the karst towers, the scenery appeared intriguingly mysterious. This morning, the darkness had lifted but left behind a layer of fog that blanketed the limestone formations, creating an eerie, yet enchanting landscape.Our day was spent exploring the area on bikes. Along the way, we pedaled beside innumerable fields of rice, ripe for harvest in a stunning green and yellow. In fact, we were familiarized with the harvesting process, spotting it in many different stages. Many locals in this rural area only knew one English word, hello. When greeting us, they yell (seriously, yelling), ""HEL-LO."" It makes me a little nervous, if I'm being perfectly honest, so I always check over my shoulder to make sure they're not sending a mob after me.I now understand why the Chinese are all thin. I would be too if I used chopsticks all the time. Towards the end of the meal, I submit to my growing frustrations and give up on trying to clean my plate. Luckily, the amazing Italian restaurant at our little bamboo palace of a hotel has forks. This is a vacation. I shouldn't have to get frustrated about eating."
"Our time in Macau was finished and today we were going back to mainland China. It was a quick ride to the border then through both sets of customs and passport checks. All went quickly with one minor embarrassment - we were asked if we were eligible for the 'special' lane in China - that's for mothers with small children and the over 65s - Fran was most incensed.We took an express bus into Guangzhou - China's third largest city. It was the normal sprawl with lots of concrete and overpasses. We played our normal game with the bus - trying to figure out where the driver would drop us. We managed to get through to the driver that we wanted the train station - so he dropped us about half a mile away from it - but didn't tell us which direction. Eventually we arrived there, hot and sweaty as it was 30C + and 90% humidity. We had tried to book our ticket to Guilin in Hong Kong but had been told that this was not possible and there would be no problem getting on the train. Not so - the train we wanted was full and the next (and last one) only had hard sleeper - so we had a long wait for the train.We filled the time with an early dinner - went into a restaurant that had a 120 items on the menu but could only find 4 items we would eat - all the rest were marked as highly spiced or had parts of animals we wouldn't touch. And even then, one of the four was off. We had an OK night on the train though half the Chinese were singing late at night and the other half got up very noisily at the crack of dawn - not conducive to a good nights sleep. When we arrived in Guilin, to our horror it was raining and chilly. We had gone from sweltering to now freezing - especially as I was dressed in shorts, T-shirt and sandals.It was a short (but wet) walk to the hotel where we managed to check in early and change. We borrowed an umbrella and went off in search of breakfast. We had been recommended a place in the middle of town so we headed in that direction. The rain steadily increased as the walk got longer (not helped by poor map reading on my part) - by the time we got there we were soaked and Fran needed the hot chocolate. We decided to abandon the sightseeing until the weather improved which it duly did mid afternoon. We had a quick look round, decided there was not too much to see in town so booked a couple of trips out for the next two days."
"As we entered China, I expected, as I believe nearly everyone does, to see communism in its most stereo-typical form... dark and cloudy days with big dull concrete block structures, police constantly peaking over your shoulder, and people that are shy and quiet because they are afraid of who is watching or listening. Now, it was a dark, cloudy and rainy day when we entered China, and I instantly felt that it was going to be hard to travel around because after leaving the border there was absolutely no English written or spoken anywhere. However, using our trusty  guidebook (which we duct-taped over the cover to prevent it from being confiscated since it is illegal in China) I was able to point to the Chinese characters of the city that we wanted to visit and from there everything got a lot easier, and, once again, nearly all my preconceptions were wrong as we passed neighborhoods of nice houses, beach resorts, and had no problems with the police or anyone else.However, even with the hospitality, it was quite an issue trying to catch multiple buses and read timetables in a script that was completely unintelligible for me, but after around twenty hours of traveling we finally made it to Guilin. Guilin is a small city located in the Guangxi Province, which is in the Southeast part of China bordering Vietnam and is nearly due West of Macau. The area here is world-renowned for its landscape, and the best way to see it is to hire a boat or raft and drift down the Li River from Guilin to Yangshuo. We were a bit pressed for time since Kelly was flying out of Beijing on the 28th of November, so we set about the morning we arrived to finding a boat and making the trip.  The ""boat"" we were on was actually a several PVC pipes lashed together to make a raft coupled with our old driver with just a few teeth using a howling long-tail motor on the back. The loud noise of the engine took away a bit of the ambiance, but we began our way past the thousands of giant limestone peaks that rise out of the ground like up-side down ice cream cones. Small bushes, trees, and vines cling to the steep slopes of the small mountains, which along with the palm trees and rice fields surrounding the bases made the area seem like a tropical and mystical dreamworld. The old world culture of the area was also still very much alive as the old men and women would stand on the banks of the river near their bamboo thatch villages using their trained cormorants (water birds) to fish for them. They also made fish farms in the river out of handwoven nets and chopped logs and would stand out in the water with their hand nets and cone-shaped straw hats casting out to harvest the fish.The ride through the picturesque peaks (karst topography) and past the many rural villages brought us to the village of Yangshuo. This beautiful little town still retains much of its old Chinese character, mainly due to tourism, but it was a wonderful place with quaint wooden buildings, hanging lanterns, and classic Chinese tiled roofs. It is a place that I would have liked to stay for some time, but now we have to move on to Xian in the Shaanxi Province. Xian is one of the most important cities in China because it was the imperial capitol of China for several centuries, but today it is well-known for being the home of the famous terracotta soldier army, which was made by China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. Till next time, Cheers."
"Day 10 Guilin After descending from the Rice Terraces, we commandeer a minivan with a Scottish couple who are the first people we have really spoken to since being away, to take us the two hours to Guilin.  The guy looks like Billy Connelly and is wearing a Scottish football top just in case anyone mistakes him for being English I suppose.  We are being approached quite regularly by Chinese people who want their photo taken with a westerner and some kids at our hotel in Guilin (our next stop) want to know where we are from; what our favourite sport is etc.  Apparently all children start learning English at school from the age of 5 now, so whenever we are stuck, we look for the youngest person around us to help us explain what we want.  We spend the rest of the afternoon lounging by the pool before booking our trip down the Li River for the next day. Day 11/12 Li River Trip and Yangshuo You will have to take our word for how beautiful the Li River is as we managed to lose the photos that we took.  The Li River scenery is used in many Chinese paintings and on one of their banknotes.  The boat trip takes about 4 hours to arrive in Yangshuo which is a more like a back packer centre than anywhere else we have seen so far - lots of cheap restaurants and people just hanging out.  The weather is tropical here and we are staying out of town in a retreat by a small river with amazing views of the many limestone karsts that dominate the scenery.  There is a constant flow of small bamboo rafts being punted down the river and over a small weir just where we are staying.  Mahjong is banned here as it is too loud!!!  The following day we rent bikes to cycle around the countryside and climb a small mountain called Moon Hill for panoramic views.  In the evening we take a trip to watch local fishermen who use cormorants to swim along side their boats and catch fish for them by forcing the birds to regurgitate the fish. Day 13 Guilin to Hanoi, Vietnam We have to get back to Guilin today to catch the train to Hanoi and need to get up early to take a hot air balloon ride which really has to be the highlight of the trip so far.  It is the first time either of us has been ballooning and something on my list of things to do before I die (although choosing to do it in China it might actually be the last thing I do before I die).  There is no safety briefing, we just hop in and take off.  The flames burn your head but the pilot seems to know what he is doing and is able to sail between the karsts and hover just above the vegetation before taking us high into the sky.  We are airborne for about 45 minutes before landing on a soon to be opened motorway.  Our train leaves at 1430 and will arrive the next morning in Hanoi at eight.  We don't really know what to expect as we have not been able to find too much info on the internet.  We end up sharing a 4 berth cabin with 2 Aussies who have just retired and are off travelling as they had done 40 years previously.  They are great company and the time flies swapping stories and drinking green tea and eating pot noodles, before heading to the dining car for a few beers. After about 6 hours we have to leave the train at Nanning for an hour while some of the carriages are split off, and then we settle down to sleep once we get back on and head towards the China/Vietnam border.  At midnight the lights come on and the Chinese immigration officers want to see our passports and are trying to work out why Lil does not speak Mandarin.  It really is a rude shock to be woken up (blind without our contact lenses) with all the commotion.  But the lights go off again and we sleep until 2 hours later when they return to give our passports back and the train sets off again.  An hour later (0300) we have to get off the train with all our belongings to clear Vietnamese immigration and change trains.  It is only when we reach the immigration office that I realise that I have left my passport under my pillow on the Chinese train and panic sets in as the train is already locked up and I have visions of it setting off back to Beijing leaving me stranded in no mans land.  Lil is now looking after my passport as I cannot be trusted!!  We are a motley collection as we clear immigration which takes about an hour - Mongolian students and two middle aged guys from Birmingham who looked like they popped out to get a paper but were actually travelling all the way to Singapore by train having set off from Moscow a few weeks earlier.  We spend the last few hours of the train journey watching the green and fertile Vietnamese countryside pass by."
"After many big cities this place feels bit like heaven. Not so much traffic, you can walk the city through and people are fewer. I really like this place. Tomorrow we'll continue to Yangshuo, 65 km south from here. It shouldbe even more remote place with not so many tourists, but I suppose it's full of back packers. In China it's impossible to find a really calm and quiet place - like in Finland where you have it in every street corner.Yesterday we visited the Reed Flute Cave. It was a magnificent, not too big cave with water dripping down and in your collar. There were lots of people so you couldn't experience a feeling being alone and inside the mountain, but nice it was in any case. The place was illuminated with different coloured lights andthe tour was based on the shapes of the rocks, stories and imagination; there you have vegetables, here a lion and here a fish.For the first time yesterday we had some nice treatments, finally. For me body massage and for Suvi a foot massage, 2,50 euro each. My body really needed massage but afterwards I felt how I never felt before after massage, It was much more rough than classical or sports massage. The girl was not only manipulating muscles but little but of everything. Afterwards I felt like not being able to control my body - but still I liked it. We'll go back today for some more foot treatments.It's morning. I'll add some text here still later. Harvinainen hetki: meika kirjottaa blogiin. Oon yrittany joskus kylla mutta aina kun yritan niin en paase tanne, naa yhteydet taalla tallasia vahan hitaamman puoleisia. Junamtka tanne kesti 14 h ja se oli ihan kauheeta oikeestaan siella ylapunkassa kun ei mahdu muuta kun makaa yhdessa asennossa (paitsi jos ois vahan laihempi ehka)... Mutta taa on ihan kiva mesta kun on rauhallista eika autot koko ajan toottaile ja kadun saa ylittaa suht rauhassa. Karsin rakataudinkin aikasemmin, en enaa muista missa sillon oltiin mutta ripulia ei oo mulle viela onneks tullu :) Yska jatkuu edelleen mutta ei niin pahana enaa, toi meidan huone on ehka ihan snadisti homeessa joten sekin vaikuttaa (ei niin paljon homeessa kun se Tour'an hostel jossain kaupungissa). Taalla kaupungissa on nyt eniten lankkareita mita tahan mennessa nahty, ees Pekingissa ei ollu nain paljoo (tai niit ei vaan nakyny meian huudeilla). No ei mulla oikeen oo nyt mitaan kerrottavaa. Moikka.TiinaNice relaxing day again in the remote city of Guilin! This place has only 500 000 inhabitants which makes the place more relaxing.Today we visited Elephant Hill. It's a hill that has a shape of an elephant drinking water from the river, hence the name Elephant Hill. We took the steps up to the hill but you can never have a view like you see on the post card pictures. Maybe if we had a helicopter flight or if we did a long hike on a high mountain we could see all the ""karst"" formed mountains that are around here.The best moment today was to dip our feet on the river. The water was clear though many tourist ferries and fisherman boats go constantly along the river.We sat on the sun,enjoying the +30 degrees and letting the feet relax in the fresh water.After having lunch we ended up meeting some man on a street. Or Tiina did, the man wanted to have a cup of coffee with her (English name Robert). He was telling how his sister lives in Helsinki and has a restaurant with her Finnish-Chinese husband - who knows if the story is true. We ended up tasting tea again and buying some local alcohol as souvenier.The plan was to visit one of the most tourist attractions in this city, Solitary Peak, but Tiina didn't wannapay. Me and Suvi neither after thinking how many similar places we already visited. So we decided to have a foot treatment again. We both wanted foot cosmetology but the language barrior showed up again and I got a foot massage which indeed was better after all. The girl was very professional and I ended up tipping for the first time - small money for me but a lot for her, compared to the salary she might get after giving me 1 hour foot massage.The place where we had our treatment has the following coordinates (if you ever visit this place): Walk along Binijiang Lu towards north. When you reach Sheraton walk still forward till the next block. You will see a book shop and a cafe/restaurant called Little Italian.You pass the Italian rest and will see two massage places. The one I recommend is the second one, on the corner. Enjoy!This eve we'll see 'The Love Guru' on DVD. Yesterday we saw 'Departed' .HelouSuvi taalla taas pitkasta aikaa. Laiskapaska ei oikee jaksa blogata, mut kuten Tiina jo kirjotti, niin naa yhteydet taalla ei oikee pelaa aina. Tassa mestassa on kyl tan matkan selkeesti nopeimmat koneet, paasee blogiin ja facebookiin helposti. Jep.Ollaan aika lailla chillailtu taalla, mika on ihan mukavaa. Eilen kaytiin siella luolassa, josta Erika kirjotti ja tanaan suunnattiin Elefanttikukkulalle. Siel oli tosi paljon kaikkia norsupatsaita ja muuta kivaa, mutta siis se on saanut nimensa siita, kun se on norsun muotonen. Piti tosiaan menna vierailemaan joillain muillakin korkeilla kukkuloilla mut paatettiin sit Erikan kaa et ei jakseta (Tiina oli jo aiemmin ilmoittanut epakiinnostuksestaan) ja suunnattiin taas hoitamaan itseamme jalkahoitolaan. Eilen meitsi otti jalkahieronnan ja tanaan sen lisaks ""foot cosmetologyn""= tyyppi raspas mun santapaperijalat. Oli muuten mieshieroja, Erikal oli nainen. Joo,en sit viittiny kysyy et oisko tyypilla ollu antaa muitakin hoitoja... (Joo hyi helvetti naa kiinalaiset miehet, en ees maksais..)Taa mesta on kyl ehka kivoin paikka missa ollaan kayty. Shanghai oli kans aika pop. Ootan kyl et paasen Hainanin rannoille lohoomaan... Ja juoksemaan pakoon malariasaaskia... Joo hmm. Mitas tas nyt kirjottais. Ma oon lukenu tal reissul ihan sikana kirjoja, kohta on kuudes luettu. Ja paatin et jatkan innkasta lukutahtia myos Suomessa. Tiina oli kyl sita mielta, et kaikki tollaset jutut, mita ulkomailla paattaa, ei tuu ikina toteutumaan. Noh, ei voi koskaan tietaa.Pitas tassa hommata pikkuhiljaa paluuliput Ranskasta Suomeen, matkaseura Pariisiin on viel vaan vahan hakusessa. Ilmoittautumisia otetaan vastaan. Mut kyl ma siella yksinkin parjaan, tuttu kaupunki. Meen katukahviloihin juomaan halpaa viinia. :) Tuskin maltan odottaa. Taalla on toi juominen jaanyt aika vahalle, johtuu a) seurasta ja b) huonoista valikoimista. Join pari pulloa kinkkibissee (Tsingtaoo,saa myos Suomesta) Xianissa mut nyt jotenki tuntuu ettei maistu enaa. Sita paitsi siina opn vaa jotai 3,5 prossaa holia, joten sita on ihan turha juoda. Breezereitakaan ei loydy oikein joka kaupungista ja ne on nii jarkyttavan makeita. Ja joo, ne parit ravintoladrinkit mita ollaan kokeiltu, on selkeesti karsiny alkoholin puutteesta tai ne on muuten ihan 'tulleen valmistettu. Mut ehka mun on hyva valilla olla enemman tai vahemman katkolla.. :)Taal Guilinissa ilmanala on ollut tosi miellyttava. Vaik on suht lammin, niin tuulee aika paljon eika hikoile ihan sairaasti koko aikaa. Onneks melkeen joka mestas on sisatilois tuuletin tai ilmastointi. Ei taal varmaan pystyis nukkuun jos huonees ei ois ilmastointia.Hahaa, Erika ja Tiina liotteli tanaan jalkojaan Li-joessa, saas naha mita matoja niihin on ehtiny kaivautua sina aikana. Ma paatin suosiolla jattaa valiin kun oli jo valmiiks jalat rikki. Oon muutenkin ylitarkka ja vainoharhanen. En edelleenkaan suostu pesemaan hampaitani hanavedella. Never ever! Joo, oon syony taalla ihan liikaa sellasta kiinalaista kamalaa vihreeta vihannesta, se tulee ulos korvista ja kaikkialta muualtakin. Jos tilaat raflassa sauteed vegetables and mushrooms, saat aina sita helvetin vihreeta roskaa ja siitakkeita. Toisinaan ne ruoat maistuu hyvalta, toisinaan ei. Pitas viel selvittaa, mika sen rehun nimi on. Se nayttaa ehka vahan sellerilta. Blaablaablaa. Tofuannoksissa on tosi usein lihaa. Niita ei viitti tilata, jos henkilokunta ei puhu enkkua. Mut nuudelilla ma taalla kai paaasiassa elan. Ja sit pistaasipahkinoilla ja kuivatuilla bataateilla. Me ei olla varmoja, onko ne bataatteja, mut epaillaan niiden olevan. Ja sokeriliemeen sailotyt mandariinit on tosi kovassa huudossa. Hehee. Ja appelsiini Minute Maid (greippi on parempaa, mut sita ei saa kaikkialta), se on kyl paljon makeempaa ku Suomes, kuten kaikki mehut taalla. Hirveen huonosti on ollu matkan varrella kunnon supermarketeja, joista sais tofua tms (tai mungpapumaitoa, njam), kaikki ""ruoka""kaupat on miltei aina sellasia kiskan kokosia. Jeps. Oon pysyny aika hyvin matkabudjetissa (jaa, oliko mulla muka oikee sellanen), rahaa riittaa viela. Muutamia majotuksia oon maksanu Visalla, mut harvassa paikassa se kelpaa taalla (mika kamala sanajarjestys). Ja sit ostin Maailman Hienoimman Pandapaidan Visalla. Jee. Vois ehka koittaa uusia vaatekertansa reissun aikana, se kyl kay osittain ihan luonnostaan ku hikoilee pilalle kaikki paidat. Ne kaikki Seppalan ja Lindexin neljan euron topit... :) Taalta voi sit ostaa tilalle kahen egen paitoja. Mun maksimihinta ois ehka 3 euroa... Hehee... Paitsi se Maailman Hienoin Pandapaita oli poikkeus. No joo. Meen nyt kokkaa nuudelii. Valmistan ne sillee et laitan kuppinuudelin sekaan soijakastiketta. Ei mitaan messis olevii mausteita, niissahan voi olla ties mita elukkaa. Hyi. :)Suvi"
"well had the most strange time visiting guilin and yangshou again a totally different experience this time! went down river on little bamboo raft and got burnt and bitten to b*****y by mozzies who seem to love me. Jim and i chewed the fat talked nonsense and drank too many beers whilst random chinese stopped to have a chat and practice their english - got some girls to listen to my ipod - they like electric six - gay bar - thanks little borther for tht one. also went to guilin and walked around dutring ghost festival so fire crackers and people in the streets partying. jurina had strange jelly pot so i tried some was surprisingly bitter - not that astonishing apparently as made from boiling turtle shells! blurgghhh but enjoyed the open air kareoke in amphitheatre overlooking the river lots of chinese singing meaningful songs about their homeland province eg mongolia- after a few beers for dutch courage jim and i decided to have a go.i got compare to tell the crowd we were singing a song from 'my homeland' which meant alot to me. we then launched into 'hey big spender' with all the shirley bassey hip wiggles! we went down a storm! we then hung round yangshou and had an interesting tussle with the boat guy who wouldnt refund our money and i had a 2 hour massage form a cute chinese lad wiht steel fingers - felt soooo good.we then mooched around guilin looking at the sites along the river and saw a community of boats and a woman sorting fish into buckets - we then ought a 2lb catfish still wriggling in the water and whilst the woman in bright blue wellies hoiked it out smacked it with a cleaver, gutted it and cut into pieces she shouted acroos to her husband who punted across river on bamboo raft and took us with still warm fish in bits in a bag back across the river to a load of rickety boats moored up on the river bank - this tranpired to be a floating cafe full of locals who looked on bemused as we got on and sat down. we had the fish cooked in pot and put bubbling on a gas flame on our squat table  made in a bean sauce with bucket oload of chillis and ginger - was amazing food - locals nearby had a plastc tub and i asked what in it  - contained homemade preserved ginger in chilli vinegar - added a real kick to the meal and made me buro like mad - was a fantastic food experience definately a top ten!"
"Ok so we arrived in Guilin, after a 22 hour train ride from Shaghai.  Oddly enough the train wasn't so bad because we basically slept about 18 hours.  I have no idea how this happened.  It could have been the gentle rocking of the tracks, mixed in with the jaring stops and random tilting....But, finally we reached our destinatin wide awake and ready to face the  world!  Except the world apparently didn't like us much, as it was POORING rain!  That's ok though cause it did clear up the next day, which is when we took our trip to the Longshen rice terraces.  That wuld be all the pictures under the Guilin photo album.  It was a fun hike up  the hill, (Nothing compared to past mountains) and as you can see, the feilds were gorgeous.  One downside was the ""cultural"" show, basically put on for the tourists, where  you have to pay a extra fee to see, local dances and the long haired women of the tribe.  Not all that fun but, Kait was game, and now we know to always avoid them.  The next day we got to go on the Li river cruise.  This is the main reason we came to this area, and it took us about 5 hours to go from Guilin to Yangshao. (Where we are now)  Absolutely stunning.  Again, I love this area of China!  We ended up taking the chinese tour.  Cause who really needs to know what peak or river bend is named what?  Plus it was about half the price of the english one. They did show up about 2 hours late...and when we actually got on the bus (more like a small van really)  There was a REALLY angery chinese man yelling at the female tour guide!  They had a screaming match back and forth for about 5 minutes.  (me and Kait like to think they were arguing about bannanas and his potassium deficiency...)Either way, we got to see the stunning scenery, and got to our next destination.  Yeah! Yangshao!"
"I'm alive! And in Guilin. Saw the rice terraces today and they were lovely. Can't upload photos cause this computer is totally ghey. But I will provide a more substantial update just as soon as I get access to a computer that works well.Off to cruise the Li River tomorrow and then stay in Yangshou a couple days. I head home a week tomorrow (the 9th) and because I go through a hole in time and space, I also arrive home on the 9th... two hours after I took off :SLots of love and I'll update more later."
"On our return visit to Shanghai we didn't really do much worth mentioning, except going to the 'world famous' acrobatics show which turned out to be great fun. The acrobats were all talented enough to pull off all the stunts and wow the crowd, but there was still a sense that everything could go horrifically wrong and that we could have ended up witnessing a mass maiming. Top stuff.Next on the agenda was the short 23 hour train ride to Guilin to begin the rural leg of our China trek. A mere 3 hour additional bus journey later and we were in Yangshuo, a small tourist town built on the banks of the Li river and set among karst rock formations that really are so much more impressive up close than they are in photographs. There we stayed at a strange little hotel called Fawlty Towers! The bloke at the desk was no Basil, and his English was slightly better than Manuel's although he wasn't as dashing. On our first full day there we went on a group cruise down the Li river in a few planks of wood with an engine nailed to the back and took in the spectacular scenery, stopping off at a riverside village on the way to see how the locals lived. In the early afternoon some of us went kayaking down the same river which was knackering, but a lot of fun, even for Jacqui whose rowing technique actually slowed down time. The bumpy bus ride back was possible the most fun thing ever.In the afternoon of the next day we took another bus to a guesthouse in the Yangshuo ""suburb"", where the skies darkened due to massive swarms of flesh eating mosquitos. After exterminating the various minibeasts who had set up residence in our room, we set out again to see the cormorant fishing show. There wasn't much to it; we ventured out along the river in a few planks of wood with an engine on the back, followed by an elderly chinese man on one plank of wood with no engine at all (he favoured a large stick of bamboo as an oar), and watched as his cormorants dived and brought back fish. He'd tied string around their necks so that if they caught a large fish they wouldn't be able to swallow it, and so had to swin back to him so he could pull it out of their thorats. Nice. After that he let us take photos of the birds on each others shoulders, which was more frightening than it sounds (just look at the photo of Jacqui trying to escape a cormorant in battle-mode). All in all, a good day.The next day was an early start for our countryside bike ride. Our local guide had neglected to tell us that today would be the first time they would attempt to take us through this particular route, and after an easy enough start surprise surprise the terrain got a little on the rocky and narrow side, and Jacqui fell off her bike and ended her face. The the afternoon we went to a Chinese cooking school, but first were taken to a proper local market for a quick tour. The place was disgusting... I mean a worthwhile and eye-opening cultural experience. There were cages packed with chickens and rabbits and tanks packed with turtles, eels and all kinds of fish, all just lying around on the floor. The our guide asked 'you want see dog??' and Jacqui said yes instantly, and so we were treated to the sight of roasted WHOLE dogs in various poses, as well as some cut in half and hanging by their necks from meathooks. My personal favourite touch was the pile of skulls on one table, which was obviously also used to prepare dog steaks or whatever in preparation for human consumption, all of which still contained eyeballs. The live ones were stuffed into cages behind the ""salesmen"" and for some reason didn't seem cimpletely happy. Anyway the cooking school itself was fun, although I didn't really feel like eating five dishes after seeing that.Our big adventure during our last days in the Chinese countryside was our hike through the longji rice terraces. Getting there was interesting as it was a three hour bus ride along impossibly narrow roads that wound up and through the mountains. There were several instances where I was sure we were going over a cliff, but somehow we made it. Our first guesthouse was still a 40 minute walk away, which was a nice touch. The rice terrance walk itself was amazing, and again is something that really needs to be seen to be appreciated. It took around three hours but the time flew by, as we were told that the terraces only look as spectacular as they did that day for two months of the year. So lucky us! Our final guesthouse was pretty average, but we were treated to a traditional performance by some of the locals, which started a little... badly, but ended up being pretty enjoyable, especially the ""bamboo dancing"", at which I am now a seasoned professional. So that's that for China as Hong Kong doesn't really count!!"
"Bonjour, nous somes partis de Xi'an le 9 avril pour faire 27 heures de train (sur des couchettes cette fois ci!) pour venir a Guilin. Le 9 c'etait la fete a Antoine, et le soir d'avant pour le niaiser, je l'ai dit a une des serveuse du resto de l'auberge... ben le lendemain, il avait un mega gateau et une assiette de fruit ! C'etait tres drole. La veille, les gars etaient aller coucher au haut de la montagne Hua (Hua Shan)(une des 5 montagnes sacrees taoiste) pas en forme pour grimper, on a decider d'y aller le lendemain en tour organise qui incluait le cable car pour monter... euh ben je peut pas vraiment vous dire de quoi ca a l'air, il avait tellement de brouillard que on avait une visibilite de genre 5 metres... pas la meilleure depense de notre voyage! La journee que les gars sont montes a la montagne, on est alle visiter les Huaquing Hot springs ou les empereurs allait ce baigner quand Xi'an etait la capitale du pays ( ca fait tres longtemps...!) Il y a une beau parc autour et on s'est fait tremper les pieds dans l'eau chaude. je vous ecrit plus tard, mon diner-dejeuner est pret ! a   emilie xxxx"
"The weather hasn't cleared up from the last blog entry so we didn't do a great deal of sight seeing done in Hong Kong.  Considering we couldn't even see Hong Kong peak, or even the tops of some of the city skyscrappers for that matter, there wasn't much point in climbing the peak for that long awaited bird's eye view of the city so a post card will have to do.   From Hong Kong we took a boat ride to Macau for a night.  Macau is part of China but it is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) like Hong Kong so people still have a degree of freedom.  The Portugese landed in Macau a few hundred years back and were allowed to stay as they opened up trade between China and the rest of Europe.  There are still Portuguese people living in Macau and there is still a hint of the Potuguese influence around town with some beautiful colonial style buildings, catholic churches and Portugese streets signs.  As far as food goes though we couldn't find anything other than chinese food.  Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal so it is like a mini Las Vegas where all the richies come for the weekend to blow their money.  Huge casinos dot the streets in between the run down apartments and street venders.  Up until 4 years ago Casino Lisboa was the only casino allowed on the small island.  When licensing restrictions where lifted big name casinos like MGM grand, the Venetian and Wynn popped up for their share of the profits.  We walked through the fancy casinos in our very underdressed atire but we didn't have a gamble.  We are backpacking afer all and are trying to keep within budget. The Chinese food here definately isn't as good as our version of chinese food back home (Justin - now i know what you were talking about).  There is definately plenty to chose from on the menu (if you can get one in English) but it is usually something you wouldn't even dream about eating like pig lung soup, chicken feet, duck hearts and pigs intestine . . . the list goes on.  We tend to stick to the basic but that usually consists of lots of rice and bok choy with a small amount of chicken or pork which is mainly bone.  As a result we have had Maccas on the odd occassion -terrible i know but sometimes you need a break from rice and bok-choy.  We arrived in Guilin in mainland China 2 nights ago and the weather is here is just as bad.  It's like the south of China is covered by a blanket of clouds and it looks like it's settled in for a while.  It's quite cold but once you get moving it gets quite steamy so the trousers that zip off into shorts are coming in very handy.  We were very spoiled in Hong Kong with most poeple being able to talk english and with western toilets with toilet paper.  Now we are in mainland China and nothing is in english and we are back to the typical Asian style of travel with squat toilets - don't forget to take your own toilet paper!  I dread when i need to take a #2, it has been a few days so i am sure that time is coming.  Our travel plans originally included us visiting and going through Tibet into Nepal.  At this stage Tibet has been closed to all tourists until May 1st which will put us out by about 10 days.  We are looking at other options at this stage, ultimately we would love to go to Tibet but we are just not sure, and nor is any one else, what is to come.  Every time we go to the internet we check the newspapers and there is often more news of riots (not in any of the places we are going so don't worry mum) which might lead to them to postponing the re-opening.  Even before all of this happened you had to get a permit to get into Tibet which is often hard to obtain.  I think with all that is going on it might be even harder.  We'll keep you all posted. Ciao - Gis and Trent"
"Hey EveryoneAfter leaving Hangzhou we spent 1 full day in Guilin. We got a sleep train from Hangzhou that took 22 hours. We shared our section of the carriage with a young Chinese family who had the cutest little boy. He was not so cute when he cried for most of the night though and kept us awake. Not sure what was worse, his crying, his dads snoring, or his mum shouting at his dad for sleeping, all when we were trying to sleep ourselves.While in Guilin we walked around the lakes and rivers and visited the Reed Flute Caves. The lakes were pretty but not as nice as West Lake in Hangzhou. We saw a man swimming in the lake although it was pretty cold by our standards! We sat down for a well deserved break on a bench where Rachel found herself a nice new bracelet! Finders keepers and all that although it did look like it belonged to a child! The Reed Flute caves were amazing! One of the best things we've done. The stalagmites and stalactities have formed shapes and patterns in the caves that the Chinese have added lights to to resemble things like a stage curtain, a tiger and a field of mushrooms and other veg. The most memorable part of the cave was lit up in blue and looked like something out of Pans Labarinth or that type of film. We managed to get some pretty impressive pics but due to the computers here we still haven't been able to upload them. We also had the chance to see 1000 yr old turtles in one of the caves (for an extra fee of course) and Luce and Vik both picked one of them up! They were so heavy!We went to a club in Guilin and placed dice while sharing some beers. An Asian man in the club showed his affection for Rach by buying her a teddy and sending it over to her via one of the barmen. The teddy looks like an alien and says on its label 'keep away from other toys'. It is not the prettiest thing we've seen that's for sure! We've named him fugly!We left Guilin by bus and arrived in Yangshou 5 days ago. This is the most touristy place we've seen so far. It's like being in the middle of Spain not China. There are so many bars and restaurants (mostly Western) along a main strip that is very reflective of the types of places in Europe that we visit on package hols. Our first two days here were spent doing nothing, just chilling out and walking along the main 'West Street'. The weather, unfortunately, has been non stop rain and haze so we haven't been able to see the mountains very well. In true 'sods law' style though the sun is shining today, typical as we leave tonight! Our third day here we went on a river cruise along the prettiest part of the Li River. The drive out to the river included going through the countryside and visiting a small market town. It was very rural and amazing to see (just a shame about the weather). While there Luce bought some sugar cane that they eat here as a sweet snack fairly regularly. We've seen it in most places before but never tried it. The river cruise itself was well worth the money and we stopped at a small cobbled beach where the locals were selling seafood that they cook infront of you on a small wok and beach fire. We all tried something fish-y, not sure what it was, but was very good and hasn't killed us yet! There was a Chinese couple on the boat with us who had a live chicken with them, in a black bag which they tied to a chair. It didn't make a sound! Although you could see it's little feet moving like it was trying to get free, it was Lucy's neighbour for some of the trip! We went to a local beauty salon here. Luce and Rach had leg waxes and Luce and Vik both had manicures. The chinese are famous for doing a meticulous job of nails and we can certainly confirm they do just that. The manicure and french polish cost 4quid, a saving of almost 12quid compared to back home and a much better job. After having both her legs waxed and then her nails done, Luce found she would struggle to put her shoes and socks back on without smudging her nails so the Chinese lady did it for her! Was very amusing!Yesterday was probably one of the most memorable we've had and will certainly not forget. We went to the water caves. To get there we had to take a local bus which is a small mini bus (6 seats) that is no more than a box on wheels! The drive along dirt tracks with lots of pot holes was certainly an experience to say the least. The buses stop to pick up passengers along the way and although there are only 6 seats they carry at least 9 people. On arrival at the caves, in the middle of a thunder storm, we stripped down to our bikinis, were given a pair of flip flops and a hard hat (that didn't fit) and followed a tour guide into the cave with a torch. Inside at times we were practically crawling through the cave with a small amount of light and headed towards a mud bath. The inside of the cave wasn't as pretty as Reed Flute in Guilin but the experience was more hands on. The mud bath was great fun. It felt very strange to walk in though. After the bath we walked down the side of the mountain the caves were in and saw some of the most amazing countryside views so far. Rice paddies and mountains for miles around! Due to the thunder storm the haze had cleared so we could see a lot further. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the cave trek, neither of us had our cameras so we've missed out on what would have been some amazing pictures. We must have looked hilarious though - 3 western girls in bikinis with red hard hats in the middle of a thunder storm! At least we didnt get our clothes wet!Today we've had a chinese cooking lesson. We learnt to cook 5 local dishes, including Beer Fish (the most famous here in Yangshou) and then got to eat the dishes afterwards! Delicious! We started that day by visiting a local produce market where we saw all the veg and spices that go into the dishes as well as the live produce section which included live chickens, rabbit, fish etc but also dogs which we haven't seen anywhere before! Luce and Rach went to have a closer look but Vik decided to stay further away though she could see one of the dead dogs hanging anyway. Luce tried to take a photo of the dogs but the Chinese don't like westerners photographing the dogs as they dont often buy it so threw a bucket of water and some some dog at her for trying!We leave tonight to head to Macau, a country in it's own right, so we are leaving China. We've been here over a month now so it will be strange to enter a western country again. We're going on a sleeper bus which should be a new experience for us as we've only been on the trains.Will update again soon (hopefully the comps will be better where we are headed from now on).Lots of Lovexxx"
"On the basis that I felt I was steadily improving I risked booking a trip down the River Li, the key attraction of Guilin, for the next day, Tuesday. It was an early start with a pick-up from the hotel, where I met Short(?) from Holland and Ben from California. I ended up spending pretty much most of the day with them despite the Tour Company managing to conjure up every foreigner in Guilin for tour party of some 40-50 people. Where were all these guys hiding? In..."
"Got a bus at 12 to Guilin train station which took 2 hours. The evening train never left until 10 so we all spread out & killed a bit of time. Internet, food shop & dinner with some of the guys. Rank toilets.Got on train to Shenzhen to get tube into Hong Kong. Took 16 hours."
"Ni HaoLast night we had another great chinese meal and we decided to try Beijing duck, to show you what you are eating is fresh they include the head on the plate so our duck was all sliced up and on the edge of the plate was the head!!!!Today was another 7am start and we had noodles for breakfast again as they are so filling.The wind was stronger today and it made the day even colder, Mel had to wear her Long Johns!!!!David our guide (chinese people adopt ..."
"Day 16-18, Lonji Rice TerracesOur trip to the Rice Terraces was a bit crazy as we boarded a very old rickety bus and headed up a very steep hill, meeting some very bizzare road works on the way!! We eventually made it to our starting point, a village in the middle of know-where!! Our guide Sam then told us we could get to our Guesthouse by one of two routes, first the easy one which takes about 20 mins and the second a 45 min trek! Being crazy as we are, we all opted for the longer of the two and as the rain started to fall we set off in search of our guesthouse! As it was so foggy we couldn't see a thing so trudged on soaking we and finally arrive just as it turned dark at our wood cabin guesthouse in a very small village. After drying off and warming up by the fire (as there was no heating!) we had a very lovely dinner and Dave along with some of the others settled down to watch Borat the movie. Myself and Helen sat around the fire keeping warm and chatting!!The second day in the rice terraces started early as we had a 5 hour trek ahead of us! We all wrapped up ready to try and keep the rain out but luckily the rain decreased as the day went on. As the skies cleared we got some spectacular views over the rice terraces and even bumped into a donkey on the narrow paths on the way!! The walk was quite treterous in places and after watching Lloyd fall over into a ditch twice in the space of two mins I had my first fall cracking my elbow on a rock! Luckily though nothing as broken and we carried on eventually arriving in the village of Ping'an. As it was only afternoon we had lunch and settled down in front of the fire to watch Hostage! The even entertainment was brought to us by the local women in the form of a minortiy performance, however the best part was when it was audience participation time!! Dave got picked as the bride in a dance and had to pick his groom! As he was blindfolded he ended up picking Cat and they had a traditional chinese wedding which involved a piggy back ride for Cat, a very bad performance of jingle bells and them drinking some very potent wine!! Very amusing for the rest of us who all just watch and laughed!! However Dave is hoping it isn't legally binding the UK!!The final day in the rice terrace was a fairly quite one, we had the morning to ourselves which we used to walk around the village. We then headed down out of the village after lunch to the bus pick up point to head back to Guillin train station. We had a few hours to pass before our train ride to HongKong which spend in Mac Donalds eating a 'good' meal before the long train journey and walking round the city!! We headed back to the train station to board our final over night train to HongKong."
Only a short stay here. Fair play to the Chinese for developing a whole tourist industry out of a very suspect looking rock formation - an elephant drinking water. Judge for yourselves from the pictures!We also took a trip to the rice terraces at Longsheng.  Feeling that we were now experienced travellers we decided to make our own way there.  By bus.  First of all it took over an hour for the bus to leave the city as it drove around picking up passengers until it was full.  Secondly we missed our stop (lack of Chinese a problem here).  Luckily we caught another bus going in the opposite direction before changing to a 'local' bus where we shared our seats with live chickens in plastic bags.  When we finally got to the terraces we were disappointed as they didn't look like any of the pictures we seen.  A great day out nonetheless.
"Despite knowing we were coming at completely the wrong time of year for the good views of the Li River that we came here for we're really glad we came anyway!We had a rather stressful couple of hours in Shenzhen train station (the border town with Hong Kong). Firstly, despite having now been officially part of China for over ten years the border was one of the most strict we have been through so far. Graham got searched, had our food for the train confiscated and we were left with some educational literature about the error of our ways! Secondly, we spent ages trying to find some Chinese money (Lloyds, quite helpfully, put a fraud block on both our cards and, as it was the weekend, the banks were closed!). These two combined didn't put Graham in the best of moods (Gemma thought it prudent to stay and look after the bags!), so when he was successful in finding money he also came back with some beer for the journey. We arrived in Guilin, at 6.45am, having somehow sent home our guidebook and couldn't remember the name of the hostel, or where it was. Quite clever we thought! Guilin was cold, misty and damp - very British! But we've had a good time, the highlight will probably be the day that will go down in history as ""The day of many modes of transport""! We set off by car (Mode No. 1) for our first destination - the Crown Caves. This was a highly surreal experience. We set off in a Slide Car (a cross between a roller coaster and a go kart and (Mode No.2!) for the caves, where we swiftly swapped to a boat on an underground river (Mode No.3) and a funny little noddy train (Mode No. 4)! The caves were cool! Vast and maze-like with lots of those stalagtites and stalagmites that we all learnt about at school (now who can remember which way round they are??!!!). The rather over the top lighting had a rather weird effect of making it feel like we were in a cross between Lord of the Rings, The Bat Cave and Fraggle Rock. The only thing missing were the doozers! We then (rather bizarrely for a cave!) caught (Mode No. 5) a lift out of the cave. We then moved onto the real reason for our outing to the Li River. We hopped onto a barge (Mode No. 6) and had a very peaceful hour sat on the front admiring the (rather misty) scenery and did not see another tourist! It was lovely. We even spotted a real cormorant fisherman (and not a fake one for tour groups), which we were quite pleased about. After the first hour we got a little taster of what it would be like to be here in the summer, when we came cross tens and tens of big tour boats crawling in a line along the only stretch of river still deep enough for them. It was horrible! And we decided that as disappointed as we were at the peaks being shrouded in mist, if was infinitely preferable to being stuck on one of those queues! After we negotiated the rather hazardous traffic in our little boat, we swapped to an even smaller boat (or more accurately, raft!) for another peaceful cruise down the river (Mode No. 7). It was owned by a little old couple and we dropped the wife off on the way to chop wood . . . we weren't quite sure about the fairness of that!When the river dried up completely we swapped to a motorbike taxi (Mode No. 8) for a very bumpy but beautiful rde through the countyside around the Li River and back to our car and onto Yangshuo, where we spent the night. Yangshuo is a small little town with a big backpacker area. It was nice and relaxing for a while, but we were glad we weren't staying there longer - we might have ended up with tie-dyed clothing and dreadlocks - it was obviously the done thing! The next day after a rather vicious and perhaps undeserved massage/beating/torture we caught the bus (and Mode No. 9!) back to Guilin, ready to catch the overnight train to Vietnam. We're due to arrive at the border at 3am, so we're not quite sure how that works!We're excited about moving onto a new country, but sad to leave China. At times it is a complete beaurocratic nightmare, but we're so glad we came as we've seen and done some fantastic things and got some brilliant memories."
"The Lonely Planet describes this as a place that you DO NOT want to stay in for long - ""go straight to Yangshou"". A place where touts and taxi drivers will aggressively harass you at every opportunity - even the noticeboard at our hostel seemed to confirm this (with warning messages from other travellers)!We quite liked the place!We weren't harassed (certainly no more than any other city) and there was enough to do to keep us busy for a few days.There is some lovely karst topography surrounding the city - shame the weather was never good enough to let us see it in it's full glory.Also worth looking at was the huge Seven Star Park - a huge city park with such wonders as the Seven Star Cave (very big); Camel Hill (looks like a camel); large plastic Disney characters everywhere (I'm sure they're an infringement of copyright); and a zoo (very depressing except for the panda's who have a brand new enclosure).However, the most famous site in Guilin is Elephant Trunk Hill (I'll let you guess what that looks like)! The most impressive thing about this rock formation is not how closely it resembles said creature, but how they try to extract as much money out of you as possible!!!"
"We are now in Guilin.  It was not our destination of choice, as there is not much here!!!  We are wanting to go to Yangshuo and you need to get a train to Guilin and then a bus to Yangshuo.  We plan to stay here for 1 night and then head of tomorrow first thing.  I dont think we are going to do much today apart from wash clothes and upload photos.  I have now uploaded the Xian and Chengdu photos for your enjoyment!!! So you can now see pics of the Pandas, Teracotta warriors and the world biggest budha!!! Stay tuned for Kunming....thats if i can be bothered uploading any more pics 2day.Ya hemos llegado a Guilin, el trayecto no ha sido tan malo! Fuimos a Carrefour y compramos pan y un poco de queso (slo vendian queso en lonchas para fundir). Ahora estamos en el hostal y hemos decidido poner la lavadora ya que no nos quedaba ropa limpia. La lavadora esta haciendo unos ruidos muy extranos parece que hay un pollo dentro. Kunming estuvo bien, fue muy diferente a los otros sitios donde hemos estado. Habia mucha gente pidiendo dinero, y mucha gente discapacitada (ciegos, y gente con lepra y otras cosas) por la calle tambien pidiendo dinero. La comida estaba bien pero la gente no era tan simpatica como en otros sitios en China. Esta noche vamos a intentar ir a un mercadillo que ponen por la noche y manana vamos a intentar ir a las terrazas de arroz, que dicen que son muy bonitas. Desde aqui queremos ir a Yangshuo y luego a Nanning que da frontera con Vietnam y hay unas cascadas muy bonitas. Bueno esto es todo por ahora. Besos a todos y seguid mandando mensajes!!"
"6th September 2007 and we arrive in Guillin a small but pictureesque city seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Day one arriving shattered after a mammoth 26 hour train journey, most of it spent asleep although a small part was being spent sitting in the restaurant carriage watching the weird and quite disgusting habits of the workers eating. They put there food on the table clothes then the maides merely wipe off the big chunks of food and put another table cloth on top. And we certainly wouldn't touch the fruit trolley after we saw the guy blow is nose all over it, lovely!!Checked into the hostel and got a taxi to the Red Flute cave. Taxi driver Trevor or Sun not sure was an absolute legend and would be our taxi man for everything. The cave was quite call to see and we even got a bamboo boat ride after for ""very good price"" apparently, although it would appear everyone wants to give you a very good price. We had a tour booked for the morning to go on the River Li but thought it would be fun to check out the nightlife here.Had a few drinks and using the local phrase of ""Gambey"" had an interesting night drinking the local Wodka spelt with a W before you question. Gambey being down your drink. A few later and a lot of high 5's with the locals and it was time for the club. A very good night, dancing on the speakers.7/9/07 - Feeling tired and hungover we wake up and John says sorry boys won't be coming on the River Li today. He would be spending the day checking out the local lavortories. The River Li was good to see but I wouldn't recommend the 4 hour boat trip along, the views become a bit ""same same"".The boat took us to a plce called Yangshou which was a lively little town were we had a nice massage to top off the day.08/09/07 - We spent the day on a bus travelling to Hong Kong, not fun took about 16 hours, I got about a couple of hours sleep in between boucing out of bed because of the poor roads.Next stop HongKong"
"Guilin, the hick town of China, or that was what it seemed when we arrived there! It was a small station in the middle of a small town! It was a hell a lot hotter than anything we had experienced before hand! The train journey had been hell. John wasn't feeling very well and we were constantly worried he was going to be sick in the bunk! We had no food and no water, it was hellishAnyway we arrived at our hostel to discover that we were in an already filling room! It was on the 4th floor, walking up all of those steps with a back pack was a nightmare! We settled in and then headed off to the Reed Flute cave. It was really impressive. The inside was massive! We didn't have a guide so we just trotted around taking some photos!We have our own cabbie in Guilin, his name is Sun, The is a legend! He took us to buy our bus tickets out this mosquito hell whole and we headed back to the hostel!The next day we had hired a speed boat to take us up the River Li. It was amazing scenery. These lime stone cliffs just jut out of the hill side like something has moulded them there, it is quite surreal!. Charles was asleep for most of the journey so missed the good bits! Oh well never mind! Ian has got the photos as I forgot to charge my camera! We were joined by an American that day called Trevor! He was a law student at YaleWe spent 3 hours cruising the river taking us to a point called Yangshou. It was a really nice town with lots of westerners, something that we had not seen a lot of if any in GuilinNext day we took the overnight 'sleeper' bus to Chenzhen! This was a small border crossing town that was located just outside Hong Kong! The journey was awful! It was supposed to take 12 hours but ended up taking 16. We had several stops by the police. The road was so bumpy and I was almost knocked out of bed on several occasions!The chinese really need to adjust the bus's and trains so that they can cater for the western build. I was about a foot long for the bus bed and the train! Meaning that my back is pretty ruined as I haven't had one nights sleep with a proper sized bed, or a comfy one at that!"
"We flew in to Guilin from Xi'an this was cheaper and easier than getting the train.We got the airport shuttle bus and then we had to jump in a taxi to get to the hostel we were booked into.We walked the wrong way at first then had to double back on our self, eventually we checked in to the dorm.We took the only empty two bunks Wayne in the top one and me in the bottom (I couldn't climb up to the top one!).We decided to have a walk along the river, where there were people swimming on both sides and on our side some guys fishing but we could see that ever though the river was wide it was not particularly deep.We walked to the end of the promenade and sat down with our legs over the side, as soon as I sat down the water rippled and I was soaked!We got back to the hostel and then took a short walk into the centre, a pedestrian area with shops.Although this time there was not a designer store in sight. The town centre was not too big so we found somewhere to eat and had a few beers before we got back to the hostel to book our trip on Li River and our sleeper bus to Shenzen (Hong Kong).We settled down to sleep after chatting to one of the other guys and then in came this man saying that Wayne was in his bed - which he wasn't, he stormed off and poked his tongue out .We had seen him downstairs laughing at himself, definitely a strange man!We slept really well and went out for a few hours to Elephant Hill.Elephant Hill is a peninsular which goes into the river and looks like an elephant is dinking from it through its trunk.It is said that the elephant was an imperial elephant that was ill and turned to stone rather than return to the emperor and the army.Up the hill there are lots of places to stop and admire the view of the river and in one spot a Chinese family asked if they could have the photo taken with us, after about 10 snaps and lots of questions about home we headed down towards the river.Where the supposed trunk hits the water there is a hole so we thought it would be a nice area to watch the river and riverbank activity from.We then crossed on a bamboo raft back to the land, there were a lot of these boats making the short crossing as well as ladies with cormorants trying to persuade you to have your picture taken with them.On the way back to the hostel and the town we walked through Elephant Hill Park which had some nice gardens and bridges over the river tributaries.Back at the hostel we were asked whether we wanted a private room as the dorm was full we said that we would move but we wouldn't pay any extra as we were happy to stay put and they moved us to a double en suite for the same price.We went for lunch in a little cafe, we were the only two in there and 2 sandwiches took over an hour!We found a department store but it wasn't that good, but we decided to buy a headset and webcam for Â£5 to make it easier to contact home.For tea we headed to a place recommended in the Rough Guide when Wayne's Schezuan fish came out it was full of dried chillies and incredibly hot, my meal was scallop (actually crab) and pea and was really bland not the best meal.We wandered back past Shan Hu Lake which has 2 pagodas in the middle which are lit up at night one red and one green, it was a really pretty place and at its best at night.We then found a market selling souvenirs and a bar where there was live music."
"Before leaving Bei Hai I decided to eat in one of the many very fresh fish restaurants. I'm used to choosing one swimming around in a tank by now, knowing that it won't be swimming around for much longer. This one, however, was picked out of the tank. thrown to the ground and summarily bashed before I could change my mind. I hate to say it but it tasted great. Maybe one of the things I like about the UK, though, is the possibly hypocritical way we fillet and de-fishify our fish, so the buying and eating process is far removed from the killing. I'll look forward to not being offered the fish head as honoured guest.The penultimate stage of my travels brought me to Guilin in Guanxi province, a mere seven hours bus ride away. Apart from getting slightly fleeced by a taxi driver in Guilin there were no problems, but with my lap top, a back pack and an enormous bag containing a whole year's stuff, I was in no position to argue, and I met Jayne, as planned in the hostel. Tourism was easy here and we booked up trips and train tickets with no hassle. Just what I wanted. They're used to foreigners here. China's so easy when you're on the tourist trail.We decided on the terraces (not up to those at Yuanyang),with a visit to the village where all the women have very long hair and, for a fee not included in the excursion price, watched a performance of song,dance and hair-unravelling, along with a roomful of other tourists watching this reality show. I dutifully took lots of photos and tried to pretend I was discovering this remote village.The next day we took the slow boat to Yangshuo down the Li Jiang River, a wonderful and very scenic experience. Lonely Planet had promised 'otherworldly topography' in Guilin and I'd only glimpsed it from afar. Now we were amongst it. As we'd taken the cheaper option of the Chinese tourist boat as opposed to the English speaking one we luckily couldn't understand the guide telling us which of the picturesque hills and oddly shaped rock faces looked like horses/beautiful women washing their hair/ dragons etc and could just watch the scenery unfold before our eyes. Chinese tour guides seem to find a lot to talk about in Chinese. The one in the bus the previous day didn't draw breath for about half an hour while her mate on the English version lasted about two minutes. Were we worse off for not knowing? I don't think so.Once in Yangshuo, trailing my bags through the docks, we found a cheap-ish hotel from the LP called the Peace Hotel. Not an apt name at that time since they were in the process of demolishing the building next door and it sounded alarmingly like the demolishing was going to spill over into our room. Otherwise it was a good place to be with a 'lovely young man' who spoke good English and became our guide/friend the next day for our bike ride. 'Friend' if the police asked, as he wasn't an official guide. We cycled on a very picturesque route, went on an extremely relaxing bamboo- rafting trip, buying beer from the river vendors for ourselves and the 'driver', eating a meal with local fruit wine (which turned out to be rice), ending up on a cave visit with more rocks (beautiful woman washing her hair/ dragon ...) and a mud bath, photographic evidence available. Yangshuo was full of Westerners, shops, restaurants, more shops, more restaurants but was a nice place to spend a few days, eat some Western food and chill out before the fifteen hour train ride to Hong Kong on Friday 13th. This turned out to be an easy and comfortable experience too and my first and last ride on a Chinese train. Next and final stop, Hong Kong, but first we had to depart from China at Shenzhen. 'One country, two systems'. I'd forgotten that we were crossing borders here, filling in three cards,  but it didn't take long and we were through."
"After the worst journey ever, we finally made it our hostel in Guilin. The Backstreet youth hostel was nice and right in the middle of the shopping district near to the river so we were im pressed..until (after having no sleep the night before) we decided to have an afternoon nap and discovered we had the hardest beds in China, and no joke you could knock on the matress and it would sound like a door.Our first day was spent chilling out, but on the night went to the Lijang dreamlike theatre to see the acrobatics show, which was amazing. After looking like tramps for the past 3 weeks we decided to get out our posh clothes (consisting of a shirt for Si and a dress for Becky) I even put on make up and earings, when we got there though our bubble was burst, as all the Chinese that had come to see it were in their usual mishmash of pyjama's and workwear! The acrobatic stunts were incredible hanging from the cieling by a rope tied round their necks, jumping and dancing, and they did tricks with swords, umbrella's, hats, and span around in cage things...which was cool as we were right at the front. Si even got his picture taken with star.The following day we set out to the Longji rice terraces. The bus came and collected us really early and it was quite a drive. a child threw up which smelt lovely, then the mother of said child threw milk all over the floor and under our seats! When someone pointed this out to them they just shrugged and it was only when I pointed it out to the driver that they made them mop it up! Our first stop was the village of long haored women (sorry don't know the name!!) Where we got to walk round and watch then do a dance and some singing. They also did a traditional wedding ceremony and got three members of the audience up to helo them, 2 Chinese one westerner. During the ceremony there is lots of bum pinching (as this is how they show love!) and an exchange of gifts, right at the end they also had to exchange a song for each other. There was only one song the westerner could sing...the worst rendition of ""I will always love you"" in the world. They also passed round some tea which tasted like bovril with bits of rice floating around in it, nice! Then they took their hair down, they only cut it twice in their life time, once when they turned 16, and again when they get married. According to our guide it also smells really bad in summer so we tried not to get too close. On the way out they gave you a shot of alcohol and then run through a load of them as they pinch your bum! After this we went on to the rice terrace which were along a windy mountain road on a little mini bus that im sure was going too fast! First it was lunch and we had a nice meal, of bamboo rice and pork and cashew nits (with 10 whole garlic cloves in there just for good measure!) We also had our first encounter with bean stick...the only vegetavle in the world that i hate and Si likes! (bean stick is actually bean stalk, and is rubbery salty white with a big leaf on the end) After this we began our hike to the top, viewing point number 2, which was quite a trek but the views were amazing and well worth it, we reccomend it to anyone thats going to China as a must do.The following day was the Li river cruise, we had three choices a private speedboat, an english tour or a Chinese boat. We went for the engish speaking tour, and this was where we met Dominic. And this was the beginning of team Panda. Our tour guide gave us stickers with a panda on them and told us we were the panda group yey! (See the pic of Si with his girly panda sticker!!!) We told Dominic the story of the man in Chengdu doing the international sign for panda (again see the pic!) and that was it team panda was formed. All day we were good little panda's (even though they ripped us off for another tour round Shangri-la - dont do it if your going there! Its like a boat trip Drayton Manor - not worth it) you see some men in loin cloths dancing and some women weaving, and thats about it, but we laughed all the way through. And the scenery of the li river rivalled the threee gorges, if they werent more impressive. They point out loads of little things on the way that are supposed to look like something (i.e the husband rock - a woman holding a baby waiting for her husband to come home, of the 9 horses fresco) we could't really see anything apart from cat rock..whcih wasnt somethng they pointed out, obviously they'd missed it cus it was the only one that was blindingly obvious to all three of us! We also met Paul from New York who we met later on for a drink when we got home, but first the Tea ceremony. In China all tours have to go to a governemt sponsored store and this time it was the tea factory. Normally you go in, have a 3 min talk then go outside again...this one was different it waent on forever!!! Also in our group were 4 Japanese women and the lady giving us the demonsatraion could speak Japanese so thats what she spoke, saying reeeeeeally long sentences for the Japanese women to translate into 2 words so i'm sure we missed loads! Then ther was the 50 thimbles of tea and the ettiquette that goes with it, and some bizzare sweets. It went on for hour with us, Paul and Dominic not having a clue whats going on!On our final day before we left for Hong Kong we rented bikes and went for a ride to the reed flute cave with Dominic. As we were cycling along we met a random Chinee woman and her Brazillian friend (Fernando) who were also going there so we just followed them. Walking round the cave was impressive altough all in Chinese so while he was pointing out the rock called The centipede and the magic mirror??? and expalining it and the Chinese were all having a good giggle we had no idea what was going on! When we got back outside we decided to rest for a minute but Fernando had to rush off, when we asked where he was going, the blunt answer came ""i'm gonna go eat some dog!""we spent the rest of the day cycling along the river and taking pics of team panda together. Our final evening was spent at Elephant trunk hill which again as you can see by the pictures was amazing but pretty self explanatory! We would also like to thank Dominic for letting us use his shower as we had been cycling all day and had given up our room.And then it was off to Hong Kong and hopefully a better train journey than last time!"
"Hello everybody!Sorry we have been really rubbish at keeping up with the site but the internet has been so slow where we have been and we have had a really hectic schedule!!!But now we have arrived safely in China and are enjoying the sites of Guilin. We had a great time in Vietnam and loved the Full Moon Party in Thailand so we are ready to chill out and enjoy the scenery. The people here are really friendly but the language barrier can be really difficult at times, we are doing lots of acting and hand gestures to get by!Tomorrow we are off on the Li River and tonight we are off to the ballet (I am betting that Steve will fall asleep within the first half an hour!!).We will be in touch when we have seen more of China and have more to report.We hope you are all well,Lots of love,Mel and Steve xxx"
"Guilin is my last real stop in China, and what a beautiful place it is!!I arrived pretty tired and to some thunderous weather, however the lightning lit up the sky and from my bus window i could make out really big hills that i couldn't wait to visit in the morning! I left the hostel, turned a few streets, and found myself on the main street standing in the shadow of some spectacular limestone mountains all around me! It reminded me a lot of when i went to St. Lucia. (DJ it was like the Pitons were all around me!) I spent the day walking around as many of the parks as i could and take as many snaps as i could.Guilin by night is also very nice all the lakes and parks light up and there are markets and street music everywhere. It proved to be a really nice way to end my time in China and i would definately love to come back to this part of China in the future.I managed to get sorted for Vietnam too i have a 4 hour train (wish me luck) to Nanning where i spend the night, then get an early bus across the border into my next stop on the world tour, VIETNAM!!!!!! I'm a cowboy...on a steel horse i ride......yeah you lot know the rest!PEACEBIG ED"
"Arrived in Guilin via a flight from Beijing....We are staying in the ""Backstreet Youth Hostel"".The plan is to take a boat ride up the Li River to a place called Yangshou (26th Jan)! We have had a good look around Guilin and seen some lovely pagodas and also visited and climbed Elephant cave....We brought a VERY CHEAP boat ride to Yangshou which leaves early tomorrow morning! It was a great price so fingers crossed it will be good and won't just be a Chinese scam!!!!!! Normally people pay 500 Yen and we paid 60 Yen...Will let you know how we get on ! Local food delights include Bamboo rat and pig intestine! I managed to photograph some chicken feet, pig nose and duck beaks at a side-street restaurant! The women thought I was mad taking photos!!! Hay we could always start eating bamboo rat in England...... Hugs xxxx"
"Hello everyone, We're now in Guilin. The flight here only took 2 hours. Really quick which was good and had dinner as well. Guilin is a small'ish town. Only takes about 30mins to walk round. It’s nice with a main road full of big shops and on the other end there are some gorgeous little back streets, market style. We went to 'Reed Flute Cave'. It’s a huge cave with rooms and passage ways here there and everywhere. It has little walk ways and some massive rooms. The photographs we took don't do it justice. It was really amazing. The lighting was cool but a little tacky in some places. Also it goes from really hot and humid to very cold as you wander through the rooms. Today was a good day!We went to the elephant park. There are no elephants here, it's just named this because of a rock formation that (if you look hard enough) just about resembles an elephant. It was very nice here with little walks and some cool scenery of huge peaks. There's a river that runs through the middle of it and it was nice to see a traditional Chinese man fishing on his wooden raft with cormorants (fishing birds). Today was also a good day! Today was not so good a day as follows... We decided to go to the Seven Peak Park. It has the largest peak in Guilin and gave a nice 360 degree view of the town. It also had a Zoo. This was a bad idea. We had always wondered if we would see any animals in horrible conditions and for this reason had kept a small memory card free to record anything we saw and to then send off to Born Free. This was it and it hit us bloody hard! What a complete dump this was. We saw this beautiful Asian black bear in the smallest of cages with just a concrete floor. No grass or hay or soft bedding. In fact it had no bed at all. It was only 3 metres by 4 metres. Cold concrete walls and steel bars at the front. It just paced up and down from sheer boredom. We took a video clip of it and a couple of pictures. Next was a small monkey that had been dress from head to toe in this ridiculous costume. It was tied to a pole on a table so it couldn't stray off. Darren tried to be discrete as possible in taking the photos but the owner saw us and just tied up the monkey tighter so we could take a better photo. It could only move now about 2 inches in any direction. And the monkeys face said it all. It was heart breaking. The photos we took of the monkey will be sent off to 'Monkey World' in Dorset. Darren kept saying lets just get out of here as it was horrible but at the same time we knew that if we did our bit, hopefully good may come out of it. The last thing we saw (this was the worst) was a gorgeous Bengal tiger in a round cage (about 5metres in diameter) with stone flooring. Inside with the tiger was the owner with his large metal stick to keep him under control. There was a water bowl, empty of course. What made this whole setup so bad was you were aloud to have your photo taken with him for less than a couple of quid. We took lots of photos and then a load of Chinese tourists came up to the cage and one by one had their picture taken of him or her sitting on the tiger. The tiger hated it. Gemma could tell this by the fact its ears went back which means he knew he would get a wack from the stick if he didn't do as he was told. And it doesn’t take a vet nurse to realise that the noise's he was making weren't of joy. Darren publicly addressed them all by saying that this was sick and don't any of you realise what your doing is so wrong. As you could of guessed, none of them spoke a word of English. We left quickly as Darren had tears in his eyes from the noise this poor tiger was making and as soon as we were outside; Gemma just broke down in tears as well. We felt good though knowing the fact we'd taken lots of pictures and a video clip and will send it off to the appropriate organisations. We were down in the dumps for ages after that. It's amazing what some humans find as entertainment isn't it!Anyway, you lot must now be seeing a pattern in all our ""Chinese"" journals. Only a few days left now if that makes sense. Hint, hint!!! We're off to Yangshuo tomorrow. So fingers crossed that after 4 weeks in this country we might find a part of it we really like. So speak to you all soon. Lots of love Darren and Gemma xxx xxx"
"Emerging through the thunder, lightning and torrential rain, we touched down in Guilin, very relieved. Not relieved to be out of the storm but relieved that we had actually got to Guilin. The flight was 5 hours delayed and after waiting for 3 hours in the airport we were taken to an airport hotel ...for an hours sleep before being dragged back to the terminal to wait some more before being able to board the plane. Arriving in the airport at 4 in the morning to find no taxis and torrential rain, ourselves and another westerner managed to find a car who took us to our hostel. It was hard work getting to Guilin (especially with a fully fledged cold) and maybe it was a sign as the following 9 days would prove to be slightly different to how we'd planned....For the first time, our detailed research had let us down. By all accounts Guilin is a sunny, warm place and this time of year should be a pleasant 20 degrees celcius. What we actually found was a chilly 12 degrees celcius with rain and and fog forecast for the next couple of weeks. Tomorrow, as we leave, the forecast is Sun.In between days of rain and days in bed with colds in Guilin we managed to hop on a river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo where we met the super lovely 'Erin' and her father. Erin translated for us, chatted through many aspects of Chinese modern culture and looked after us generally fending off the touts and making sure we got the best of everything. Twisting down the river on a boat was not a bad way to see the strange and ever changing shapes of the Karst hills around. We ended up in Yangshuo and whiled away the afternoon people watching whilst drinking tea and then wandering up a peak in the local park where we were recruited to correct Chinese men's English homework before chatting with them until sundown. It is very apparent how money orientated the Chinese are. Or 'realistic' as they put it. One of the men we were chatting to had been brought up in the countryside and had worked as a carrier. He realized he had no prospect of a wife and a nice house so he had set up camp in Yangshuo to learn English so he could then go to the city and get a good job and a wife. ""No money, no honey"" as they put it.Our next trip to Long Ji terraces created another serendipitous encounter with Erin and her father. The Long Ji terraces are where the stepped rice fields snake round and are given names such as 7 star and 1 moon and 9 snake 5 dragon terraces. Unfortunately, zero visibility (fog) meant we were not able to fully appreciate these man made wonders but a stop on the way to ""Long Hair Village"" was quite entertaining: girls only cut their hair once in their lifetime. Luckily they do have a choice of when they can do it, either when they turn 18 or when they get married. Their abodes were quite unusual too where the livestock sleep on the ground floor and the humans on the floors above because of the risk of snakes.After another bout of illness we then shuffled along to Elephant Hill where the hill looks, as might be expected, like an elephant drinking from the water.After Guilin we headed back to Yangshuo to stay for a few days and in between food poisoning bouts we took a bus to ""Moon Hill"" where rock climbers and view-seekers coexist peacefully and took a walk through some locals villages which involved a stick fight with some local children and some more amazing views of the river. Yangshuo and Guilin have been a bit of a wash-out compared to what we had planned but hopefully after several days forced relaxation we are strong and healthy and ready for our next adventures. Tonight we take the sleeper bus to Shenzhen and then a train to our next stop: Hong Kong (again!)."
Nehow!Helen here!We're sitting in an internet cafe in Guiling which is very smelly and dirty- which suits us because we have all been wearing the same clothes for the past 3 days! We're not bothered as we have had a fantastic time visiting the rice fields in the Longi Valley- pictures will follow!We've stayed in 2 different tribal villages - trekking from the 1st to the 2nd! The scenery was out of this world and it was great to see all the diffe...
